# Mechanism of fracture
- Greatly influenced by plasticity of material
- Ductile fracture (of plastically deformed material) gives uneven fracture surface
- Plasticity depends on temperature (metals tend to be brittle at room temp.)
## Brittle fracture
- Estimation using idealised Lennard-Jones potential: overestimates strength at $0.04E$
- Real materials: contains flaws and cracks
- Upon loading, lines of force bend around the crack
	- Stress free region above and below crack (along direction of lines of force)
	- Concentration of stress near tip
- Failure caused by crack propagation
	- Crack extension creates new surfaces, which requires energy
	- Energy supplied by release of elastic energy in stress-free region
	- Griffith criterion: strain energy release rate ($G$) $\geq$ surface energy $2\gamma$
		- For a crack of length $2c$
		- $G$ depends on geometry, $\approx \sigma_0^2 c/E$ 
$$\sigma_*=\sqrt{\frac{2\gamma E}{\pi c}}$$
	- A larger crack is easier to propagate
	- For a given stress $\sigma_0$, there is a critical flaw size $c_*=2\gamma E/(\pi\sigma_0^2)$
		- Material fails if a flaw length exceeds $2c_*$
- Source of flaws: mostly surface
	- Removing flaws: polishing or putting surface into compression
	- Fracture energy stays the same
- Elongation of cracks: corrosive environments, cyclic loading

## Ductile fracture
- Tip of the crack is a stress concentration point
- In ductile materials, a zone of plasticity forms at the tip as dislocations pile up
	- Increases radius of curvature (blunting)
	- Reduces stress concentrating effect
- Work done in plastic deformation is dissipated as heat
- Much higher strain energy release rate required
	- $G \geq 2(\gamma+\gamma_p)$
	- $\gamma_p>>\gamma$

# Fracture in engineering materials
- Composites tend to be tougher as fibres have to pull out for failure
- Pipes: hoop stress is twice axial stress--> bursting is longitudinal
## Fracture toughness
- Critical strain energy release rate $G_c$ is a material constant
- Determination of $G$ is difficult
- Fracture toughness: $K_c=\sqrt{G_cE}$
- Fracture: combinations of $\sigma$ and $c$ (depends on geometry) equals $K_c$
- $K_c$ can be determined by non-destructive methods

## Ductile-brittle transition
- Heating leads to increased plasticity and toughness
- High strain rate and reducing temperature both lower toughness
- Materials testing: high strain rate (high impact pendulums)
- Crystal structures influence slip systems, plasticity, therefore fracture behaviour
	- Metals undergo phase transitions as a function of temperature
	- Some slip systems require thermal activation
	- Example: hcp metals are brittle at room temperature
