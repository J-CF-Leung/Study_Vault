## Fe-C system
- Actual equilibrium phases include graphite which is slow to form
- Quasi-equilibrium phases usually considered (Cementite instead of graphite)
- Principal phases:
	- Ferrite ($\alpha$, bcc)
	- Austenite ($\gamma$, fcc)
	- $\delta$, bcc
	- Cementite ($\ce{Fe3C}$)
![[Fe-C phase diagram.png|600]]
- Transformations: 
	- [[Microstructure and phases of mixtures#Phase diagrams|Definitions]]
	- 1 eutectic transformation, 1 eutectoid transformation, 1 peritectic transformation
- Eutectoid transformation: Austenite --> Ferrite+Cementite
	- Intergrowth of ferrite and cementite: pearlite
	- Pearlite: soft and tough (dislocation motion and crack propagation are more difficult)
- Carbon steels often alloyed with other elements for corrosion resistance/strength/ stiffness
- Rapid cooling gives martensite via [[Phase transitions in materials#Displacive and reconstructive transformations|displacive]] phase transition
	- Super-saturated solid solution
	- Carbon is located at octahedral interstice of body-centred tetragonal cell
	- Lattice under strain, making martensite brittle
	- Can be tempered/annealed to form precipitates of cementite
	- Precipitates impede dislocation motion and make the material stronger

## Al-Cu system
- $\ce{Al-Cu}$ alloys are common in aerospace applications
![[Al-Cu phase diagram.png|500]]
- Eutectic on $\ce{Al-}$rich side
	- ccp $\ce{Al-}$ based solution $\alpha$, with $\theta$, principally tetragonal $\ce{Al2Cu}$
- Sub-micron features required for aerospace applications
- Commercially used alloy: hypoeutectic, $\approx 4\,wt\% \; \ce{Cu}$
	- Copper initially in solution, then the alloy is quenched then annealed at lower temperature
	- Thermodynamically stable microstructure: $\theta$ precipitates
	- $\theta-\alpha$ interface is very incoherent, leading to metastable phases during annealing
	- Initial: atom-thick discs of $\ce{Cu}$ from homogeneous nucleation (Guinier-Preston zones)
	- Next: $\theta''$ with tetragonal structure, disc-shaped and coherent with $\ce{Al}$ matrix
	- Next: $\theta'$ with incoherent interfaces, nucleated heterogeneously
	- Finally, fully incoherent equilibrium $\theta$ phase forms
	- Gibbs Free Energy lowered with each step
	- Precipitates mechanically strengthen the metal
