# The fundamental principles of Einsteinian relativity
1. The laws of physics are _identical for all inertial frames of reference_
	- The _forms_ of the laws are _invariant with respect to coordinate transformations_
2. The velocity at which interactions _propagate_ (aka. the maximum possible velocity in the universe), the speed of light $c$, is the same in all inertial frames of reference
$$c=2.99792458\times10^8\,m\,s^{-1}$$
- In Galilean relativity, distances are relative, and time is absolute
- In Einsteinian relativity (or just relativity), neither distance and time are absolute
	- From the fact that _no velocities exceed_ $c$
	- This implies that _simultaneity_ of events varies across frames
	- Galilean relativity can be obtained by letting $c\rightarrow\infty$
