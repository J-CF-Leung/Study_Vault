## The fundamental principles of Einsteinian relativity
1. The laws of physics are identical for all inertial frames of reference
2. The velocity at which interactions propagate (aka. the maximum possible velocity in the universe), the speed of light $c$, is the same in all inertial frames of reference
$$c=2.99792458\times10^8\,m\,s^{-1}$$
- In Galilean relativity, distances are relative, and time is absolute
- In Einsteinian relativity (or just relativity), distance and time are not absolute
	- Galilean relativity can be obtained by letting $c\rightarrow\infty$
