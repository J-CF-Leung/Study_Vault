- Many principles from [[Special Relativity]] still apply:
	- The laws of physics are _invariant_ across _inertial reference frames_
	- The _speed of causality_ for _all observers_ is the _speed of light in vacuum_ $c$
	- There is _no longer absolute time or simultaneity_
- Like special relativity, laws are written in terms of _geometric objects_, such as _vectors_ and _tensors_

- Notation: [[Einstein notation]]
- Apply the language of [[Special Relativity#Component representation|tensors, covariant and contravariant components]]
# Motivation

## The weak equivalence principle
- _Newtonian_ gravity asserts that the _gravitational force_ felt by an object is determined by some _gravitational potential_ $\Phi_G$
- Let there be some _passive gravitational mass_ $m_G$, the force on it is:
$$\bm{F}=-m_G\nabla\Phi_G$$
- The potential is determined by a _mass density_ $\rho$:
$$\nabla^2\Phi_G=4\pi G\rho$$
- This implies that the potential can _change instantly throughout space_, which is already _inconsistent with special relativity_

- This _mass density_ is _not necessarily required to be the passive gravitational mass_
- Instead, define it as an _active gravitational mass_, where such a point mass has density:
$$\rho(\bm{x},t)=m_A\delta^3(\bm{x}-\bm{y}(t))$$
- Let there be mass $m_{G,1}$ at $\bm{x}_1$ at time $t$, and another mass $m_{A,2}$ at $\bm{x}_2$ also at time $t$, then the corresponding _forces_ are:
$$\displaylines{\bm{F}_{1\text{ on }2}=Gm_{A,1}m_{G,2}\frac{\bm{x}_1-\bm{x}_2}{|\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1|^3}\\\bm{F}_{2\text{ on }1}=Gm_{G,1}m_{A,2}\frac{\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1}{|\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1|^3}}$$
- Due to _momemtum conservation_, they are _equal and opposite_, hence:
$$m_{A,1}m_{G,2}=m_{G,1}m_{A,2}$$
- Therefore, the _ratio_ between $m_A$ and $m_G$ must be _constant for all masses_, and this ratio can be _absorbed_ into the _gravitational constant_ $G$

- Meanwhile, from _Newton's second law_:
$$\bm{F}=m_I\frac{d^2\bm{x}}{dt^2}$$
- where $m_I$ is the _inertial mass_
- Experiment shows that for _all masses_, $m_I/m_G$ is constant, and can be further absorbed into $G$
- This leads to the _weak equivalence principle_:
>[!info] Weak equivalence principle
>Given a gravitational field, the trajectory of a freely falling point mass depends only on their initial position and velocity, and is indepenent of structure or composition
- This is _unique to gravity_, as for _electromagnetic fields_, the trajectory depends on the _ratio between charge and mass_

## The strong equivalence principle
- Further thought experiments led to the _strong equivalence principle_:
>[!info] Strong equivalence principle
>In a small enough region of space, that is non-rotating and free-falling under some gravitational field, the laws of physics reduce to that of special relativity
- An equivalent statement is that it is _impossible to tell using local experiments_ whether one is in a _gravitational field_ or is simply _in an accelerating frame_
- If the region of space is _large_, then one can infer the existence of a gravitational field via _tidal effects_
- The equivalence principle is a _local statement_

>[!quote]
>At that moment I got the happiest thought of my life in the following form: In an example worth considering, the gravitational field has a relative existence only in a manner similar to the electric field generated by magneto-electric induction. _Because for an observer in free-fall from the roof of a house there is during the fall_—at least in his immediate vicinity—_no gravitational field._
>- Einstein in 1920, about his time at a patent office in 1907

## Conclusions
- The equivalence principles suggest that gravitational fields are determined by the _local structure of space-time_
- A _local inertial reference frame_ will still resemble the [[Special Relativity|geometry of special relativity]]
- Gravity manifests itself as the global _curvature of space-time_, caused by the presence of _matter_

- Experimental evidence (gravitational waves, mercury's precession) has shown that for _extreme gravity_, Einsteinian relativity is _much more accurate than Newtonian mechanics_

- The above conclusions motivate the description of spacetime as a _manifold_
- In _special relativity_, _Minkowski spacetime_ is a 4-dimensional manifold
- In _general relativity_, spacetime is a _manifold_ that responds _dynamically_ to mass and energy

# Manifolds
- _Informally_, an $n-$dimensional manifold is a _surface_ on which one can have a _network_ of _coordinate patches_, where the surface _resembles_ $\mathbb{R}^n$, but only _locally_
- In relativity, the _network_ is a set of _events_, and the whole _patch_ is _spacetime_

## Manifolds and coordinates
- Formally, an $n-$dimensional manifold is a _structure consisting of_:
	- A _set_ $\mathcal{M}$ of _points_ $P$
	- A _countable_ family of _subsets of_ $\mathcal{M}$, known as _fundamental coordinate patches_ $C_\alpha$, such that the _union_ of all $C_\alpha$ is the whole set $\mathcal{M}$
	- One can _map_ each $C_\alpha$ to an _open subset of_ $\mathbb{R}^n$, with each point having _coordinates_ $x^a=(x^0,x^1,\dots,x^n)$
- Generally, one is _unable_ to _cover_ the entire manifold with _one non-degenerate patch_
	- Requirement that $C_\alpha$ is mapped onto an _open subset_
- The manifold is _differentiable_ if the patches are joined _smoothly_

- Manifolds are often _embedded_ in some higher-dimensional Euclidean space
	- This is not a _necessary condition_ for a manifold to exist
- An example of a manifold is the _set of 3D rotations_ in space
- Or, a _2-sphere_ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, defined by $x^2+y^2+z^2=a^2$
	- The _spherical polar coordinates_ become _degenerate_ at the poles, so two coordinate patches are required

- The _coordinates_ of a point on a manifold are _not unique_, and can be _transformed_ (e.g. denoted $x^a\to x'^a$)
	- The _point_ itself is unaffacted by transformations as it is a _geometric object_

### Coordinate transformations
- Coordinate transformations are viewed as _passive_, as points are simply _relabelled_
- The map is denoted:
$$x^a\to x'^a=x'^a(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)$$
- Assume the function is _smooth_ and _differentiable_

- Consider two _infinitesimally close points_ $x^a$ and $x^a+dx^a$
- In the _new coordinate system_:
$$dx'^a=\pd{x'^a}{x^b}dx^b$$
- This defines a _transformation matrix_:
$$J^a_b=\pmatrix{\partial x'^1/\partial x^1 & \dots & \partial x'^1/\partial x^n \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \partial x'^1/\partial x^n & \dots & \partial x'^n/\partial x^n}$$
- The _determinant_ $J\equiv\text{det}(J^a_b)$ is known as the _Jacobian_ of the transformation
- If $J\neq0$ for _some range_ of coordinates, the transformation is _locally invertible_:
$$\displaylines{x^a=x^a(x'^1,x'^2,\dots x'^n) \\ \pd{x'^a}{x_b}\pd{x_b}{x'^c}=\delta^a_c}$$
- The _determinant_ of the inverse is then $1/J$
## Structures on a manifold
- Once manifolds are defined, one can support _objects_ on this manifold
	- _Scalar fields_ $\phi(x^a)$
	- _Curves_ $x^\mu(s)$
	- _Surfaces_ $x^\mu(s^1,s^2,\dots s^m)$
	- _Tangent vectors_ $dx^\mu/ds|_{s_0}$ _along a curve_
	- _Tangent spaces_, a collection of _tangent vectors for all curves passing through a point $s_0$_, which forms a _vector space_, with the _same dimension_ as the _manifold_

- A _scalar field_ is the simplest structure, a _map_ assigning each point $P$ a _number_ (real or complex), which can be expressed as a _function of coordinates_ $\phi(x^a)$
- This value is _independent of coordinate system_
- Therefore, if one performs a _coordinate transformation_ $x_a\to x'^a$, one must define a _new function_:
$$\phi(x^a)=\phi'(x'^a)$$
### Curves and surfaces
- Curves and surfaces are _subsets_ of points on a manifold
- A _curve_ is defined _parametrically_, with a single parameter:
$$x^\mu=x^\mu(s)$$
- Meanwhile, a _surface_, or _submanifold_ of dimensionality $m$ requires $m$ parameters:
	- $m<n$, the dimensionality of the embedding space
$$x^\mu=x^\mu(s^1,s^2,\dots s^m)$$
- The _special case_ $M=N-1$ is known as a _hypersurface_
- One is able to _eliminate_ the parameters from the $n$ equations, such that there is _some function_ $f$:
$$f(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)=0$$

- Similarly, for some $m-$dimensional surface, one can have $n-m$ constraints:
$$f_1(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)=0,\dots, f_{n-m}(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)=0$$
- This is the _intersection_ of $n-m$ hypersurfaces, as an _alternative to the parametric representation_
### Vectors and the tangent space
- On a manifold, _vectors_ are _associated with the points themselves_
	- In other words, they are _local_
	- Vectors from _one point to another_ will _have no meaning_ as _parallel displacement is not possible_ on a _curved manifold_
	- This also means one _cannot add vectors associated with different points_
- They must be _defined_ as being an element of the _tangent space_ at that point
	- It is an $n-$dimensional _subspace_ of the embedding space
	- One can also define the _tangent bundle_ for manifold $M$, denoted $T(M)$, which is the _set of all tangent spaces_, forming a $2n-$dimensional manifold 

- One must define the _tangent space_ using objects _intrinsic to the manifold_ $M$
- Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the _space of all smooth functions_ on the manifold
	- $C^\infty$ maps $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ 
- Any _curve_ passing through some point $p$ defines a _directional derivative_ $f\to df/ds|_p$

- The _tangent space_ $T_p$ is then the _space of directional derivative operators along curves_
	- One can demonstrate that the operators fulfill the requirement for a _vector space_

- The _basis_ of a tangent space is the set of vectors $\hat{e}_\mu=\partial_\mu=\partial/\partial x^\mu$
	- _Any_ directional derivative is a _linear combination_ of $\{\partial_\mu\}$

- From the _chain rule_, one gets the _transformation law_ for basis vectors:
$$\partial_{\mu'}=\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\partial_\mu$$
- One then gets the _transformation law for components_ of vector $V=V^\mu\partial_\mu$:
$$\displaylines{V^\mu\partial_\mu=V^{\mu'}\partial_{\mu'}=V^{\mu'}\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\partial_\mu \\ V^{\mu'}=\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\mu}V^\mu}$$
- This transformation is _not necessarily linear_

- The _tangent vector_ to a curve $x^a(u)$ can then be defined:
$$\frac{d}{du}=\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\pd{}{x^\mu}$$
- These vectors are _contravariant_
## Covariant/dual vectors
- One can define _covariant vectors_
- For example, the _gradient_ of a _scalar field_:
$$X_\mu=\pd{\phi}{x^\mu}$$
- The _component transformation_:
$$X_{\mu'}=\pd{\phi'}{x^{\mu'}}=\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{\phi}{x^\nu}=\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\mu'}}X_\nu$$
- This is a _covariant vector_, which inabits the _dual space_ to that of the contravariant vectors

- The _basis_ in this dual space are then the _gradients_ $\hat{e}^\mu=dx^\mu$
	- One can verify that they are _orthonormal_ to the other basis:
	$$\hat{e}^\mu\cdot\hat{e}_\nu=\pd{x^\mu}{x^\nu}={\delta^\mu}_\nu$$

- _Summing_ a product of _contravariant_ and _covariant_ vectors makes a _scalar_, which is _invariant under transformations_:
$$X_{\mu'}V^{\mu'}=\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\lambda}X_\nu V^\lambda={\delta^\nu}_\lambda X_\nu V^\lambda=X_\nu V^\nu$$

## Tensors
- At a given point $P$ on the manifold, one can define a _tensor_, a _multilinear map_
- A $(k,l)$ tensor takes $k$ _contravariant_ vectors and $l$ _covariant_ vectors to produce a _scalar_
	- The tensor is said to have _rank $k+l$_
	- Tensor _components_ can be said to be completely _covariant, contravariant, or mixed_
- The linearity of a type $(1,1)$ tensor:
$$\begin{aligned}T(\alpha W_\mu+\beta X_\mu,\gamma V^\nu+\delta Z^\nu)&=\alpha\gamma \,T(W_\mu,V^\nu)+\alpha\delta\,T(W_\mu,Z^\nu) \\ &+ \beta\gamma \,T(X_\mu,V^\nu)+\beta\delta\,T(X_\mu,Z^\nu)\end{aligned}$$
- Like _vectors_, tensors are _geometric objects_ that are _coordinate independent_

- Its _components_ in some given basis are:
$${T^{\mu_1\dots \mu_k}}_{\nu_1\dots \nu_l}=T(dx^{\mu_1},\dots dx^{\mu_k},\partial_{\nu_1},\dots\partial_{\nu_l})$$
- Like _vector components_, tensor components can also be _transformed_:
$${T^{\mu_1'\dots \mu_k'}}_{\nu_1'\dots \nu_l'}=\pd{x^{\mu_1'}}{x^{\mu_1}}\dots \pd{x^{\mu_k'}}{x^{\mu_k}}\pd{x^{\nu_1}}{x^{\nu_1'}}\dots \pd{x^{\nu_l}}{x^{\nu_l'}}{T^{\mu_1\dots \mu_k}}_{\nu_1\dots \nu_l}$$
	- The _primed coordinates_ remain _"upstairs/downstairs" on both sides_
### Tensor operations
- _Addition_ is done _by component_:
$$(T+S)_{\mu\nu}=T_{\mu\nu}+S_{\mu\nu}$$
- One can check that this _still obeys the transformation law_

- The _outer product_ of a $(p,q)$ tensor and an $(r,s)$ tensor produces a $(p+r,q+s)$ _tensor_
- The outer product of $S$ and $T$ is _denoted_ $S\otimes T$, with _components_:
$${(S\otimes T)^{\lambda_1\dots\lambda_p\mu_1\dots\mu_r}}_{\nu_1 \dots\nu_q\xi_1\dots\xi_s}={S^{\lambda_1\dots\lambda_p}}_{\nu_1 \dots\nu_q}{T^{\mu_1\dots\mu_r}}_{\xi_1\dots\xi_s}$$
- For example, the _outer product of two contravariant vectors_ creates a $(2,0)$ _tensor_

- The operation of _contraction_ sets a _contravariant_ and _covariant_ index _equal_, then proceeds to _sum_ them
- A $(k,l)$ tensor is _contracted_ to a $(k-1,l-1)$ tensor
- The tensor $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\nu}$ has _possible contractions_ $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\lambda}$, $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\lambda}{\nu}$, and $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\mu}$
	- They all form _vectors_, either _covariant or contravariant_
	- In general, these are _not equal_
- A _contraction_ of $(1,1)$ tensor $v^\mu X_\nu$ is a _scalar_

### Expansion of tensor
- The _components_ of a tensor:
$${T^{\mu_1\dots \mu_k}}_{\nu_1\dots \nu_l}=T(dx^{\mu_1},\dots dx^{\mu_k},\partial_{\nu_1},\dots\partial_{\nu_l})$$
- This can be expressed using the _outer product_:
$$T=\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}(\partial_{\mu_1}\otimes\dots\otimes\partial_{\mu_k}, dx^{\nu_1}\otimes\dots\otimes dx^{\nu_l})$$

### Symmetry and antisymmetry
- A type $(0,2)$ tensor $S_{\mu\nu}$ is _symmetric if_ $S_{\mu\nu}=S_{\nu\mu}$
- It is _antisymmetric_ if $S_{\mu\nu}=-S_{\nu\mu}$

- One can _decompose_ any second-rank tensor into _symmetric and anti-symmetric parts_:
$$S_{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}+S_{\nu\mu})+\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}-S_{\nu\mu})$$
- One can denote the _symmetric and anti-symmetric parts_ by:
$$S_{(\mu\nu)}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}+S_{\nu\mu}) \hspace{1.5cm} S_{[\mu\nu]}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}-S_{\nu\mu})$$
- One can then _generalise_ this to an $n-$th rank tensor:
$$\displaylines{S_{(\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n)}=\frac{1}{n!}(S_{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n}+S_{\mu_2\mu_1\dots\mu_n}+\dots) \\ S_{[\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n]}=\frac{1}{n!}(S_{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n}-S_{\mu_2\mu_1\dots\mu_n}+\dots)}$$
- The first sum is over _all possible permutations_
- The second sum is an _alternating sum_, with a _negative sign for odd permutations_
- $1/n!$ is a _normalising factor_ such that for a _totally symmetric matrix_, $S_{(\mu_1\mu_2\dots)}=S_{\mu_1\mu_2\dots}$

- One can also _symmetrise over a subset of indices_:
$$S_{(\lambda\mu)\nu}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\lambda\mu\nu}+S_{\mu\lambda\nu})$$
- Symmetrisation can only take place _among only covariant or contravariant indices_
- The symmetry of the tensor is _independent of coordinate basis_

### Quotient theorem
- _Not all_ sets of quantities labelled with indices are _necessarily tensor components_
- Tensors must satisfy some _quotient relation_

- If a set of quantities, when _contracted_ with an _arbitrary tensor_ produces _another tensor_, the _original set must form the components of a tensor_
- Example: a set of quantities $\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}$, contracted with vector $v^\alpha$:
$$\displaylines{\tenscom{T'}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}v'^\nu=\pd{x^{\lambda'}}{x^\lambda}\pd{x_{\mu'}}{x_\mu}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}v^{\nu}=\pd{x^{\lambda'}}{x^\lambda}\pd{x_{\mu'}}{x_\mu}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}\left(v^{\nu'}\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\nu'}}\right) \\ \tenscom{T'}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}=\pd{x^{\lambda'}}{x^\lambda}\pd{x_{\mu'}}{x_\mu}\pd{x_{\nu'}}{x_\nu}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}}$$

## The metric tensor
- The _geometry_ of a manifold is defined by its _metric_
- Consider two _neighbouring points_ on a manifold, with coordinates $x^\mu$ and $x^\mu+dx^\mu$
- The _local geometry_ there is given by the _interval_

- On a _Riemannian manifold_, the interval takes the form:
$$ds^2=g_{\mu\nu}(x)dx^\mu dx^\nu$$
- The interval is _quadratic in coordinate differentials_
- $g_{\mu\nu}$ are components of the _metric tensor_
	- Each component is known as a _metric function_
	- Components are _dependent on coordinate system_
- Example: the _Minkowski metric_ $\eta_{\mu\nu}$, where $ds^2=dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2$

- The geometry is _Riemannian_ if $ds^2>0$, and _pseudo-Riemannian_ if not

- The metric can always be chosen as _symmetric_
	- The _antisymmetric_ part contributes _zero to the interval_
- From this, for an $N-$dimensional manifold, there are $N(N+1)/2$ _independent metric functions_ at each point

- As the interval is _invariant under transformations_:
$$\displaylines{ds^2=g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu=g_{\mu'\nu'}\,dx^{\mu'}dx^{\nu'} \\ g_{\mu'\nu'}(x')=\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\nu'}}\,g_{\mu\nu}(x(x'))}$$
- As there are $N$ _arbitrary_ coordinate transformations one can perform, there are only $N(N-1)/2$ _independent functional degrees of freedom_ for the tensor
