- Many principles from [[Special relativity]] still apply:
	- The laws of physics are _invariant_ across _inertial reference frames_
	- The _speed of causality_ for _all observers_ is the _speed of light in vacuum_ $c$
	- There is _no longer absolute time or simultaneity_

# Motivation
- _Newtonian_ gravity asserts that the _gravitational force_ felt by an object is determined by some _gravitational potential_ $\Phi_G$
- Let there be some _passive gravitational mass_ $m_G$, the force on it is:
$$\bm{F}=-m_G\nabla\Phi_G$$
- The potential is determined by a _mass density_ $\rho$:
$$\nabla^2\Phi_G=4\pi G\rho$$
- This implies that the potential can _change instantly throughout space_, which is already _inconsistent with special relativity_

- This _mass density_ is _not necessarily required to be the passive gravitational mass_
- Instead, define it as an _active gravitational mass_, where such a point mass has density:
$$\rho(\bm{x},t)=m_A\delta^3(\bm{x}-\bm{y}(t))$$
- Let there be mass $m_{G,1}$ at $\bm{x}_1$ at time $t$, and another mass $m_{A,2}$ at $\bm{x}_2$ also at time $t$, then the corresponding _forces_ are:
$$\displaylines{\bm{F}_{1\text{ on }2}=Gm_{A,1}m_{G,2}\frac{\bm{x}_1-\bm{x}_2}{|\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1|^3}\\\bm{F}_{2\text{ on }1}=Gm_{G,1}m_{A,2}\frac{\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1}{|\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1|^3}}$$
- Due to _momemtum conservation_, they are _equal and opposite_, hence:
$$m_{A,1}m_{G,2}=m_{G,1}m_{A,2}$$
- Therefore, the _ratio_ between $m_A$ and $m_G$ must be _constant for all masses_, and this ratio can be _absorbed_ into the _gravitational constant_ $G$

- Meanwhile, from _Newton's second law_:
$$\bm{F}=m_I\frac{d^2\bm{x}}{dt^2}$$
- where $m_I$ is the _inertial mass_
- Experiment shows that for _all masses_, $m_I/m_G$ is constant, and can be further absorbed into $G$
- This leads to the _weak equivalence principle_:
>[!info] Weak equivalence principle
>Given a gravitational field, the trajectory of a freely falling point mass depends only on their initial position and velocity, and is indepenent of structure or composition
- This is _unique to gravity_, as for _electromagnetic fields_, the trajectory depends on the _ratio between charge and mass_

- Further thought experiments led to the _strong equivalence principle_:
>[!info] Strong equivalence principle
>In a small enough region of space, that is non-rotating and free-falling under some gravitational field, the laws of physics reduce to that of special relativity
- An equivalent statement is that it is _impossible to tell using local experiments_ whether one is in a _gravitational field_ or is simply _in an accelerating frame_
- If the region of space is _large_, then one can infer the existence of a gravitational field via _tidal effects_
- The equivalence principle is a _local statement_

>At that moment I got the happiest thought of my life in the following form: In an example worth considering, the gravitational field has a relative existence only in a manner similar to the electric field generated by magneto-electric induction. _Because for an observer in free-fall from the roof of a house there is during the fall_—at least in his immediate vicinity—_no gravitational field._
>- Einstein in 1920, about his time at a patent office in 1907

- The equivalence principles suggest that gravitational fields are determined by the _local structure of space-time_
- A _local inertial reference frame_ will still resemble the [[Special relativity|geometry of special relativity]]
- Gravity manifests itself as the global _curvature of space-time_, caused by the presence of _matter_

- Experimental evidence (gravitational waves, mercury's precession) has shown that for _extreme gravity_, Einsteinian relativity is _much more accurate than Newtonian mechanics_
