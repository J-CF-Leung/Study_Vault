- _Dirac equation_: describes _relativistic_ particles quantum mechanically

- The _Weyl equation_, a _simplified_ version of the _Dirac equation_
- _Weyl fermions_:
	- Massless
	- Are _chiral_
	- _Not observed_ in _high-energy_ experiments

- _Weyl semimetals_: containing _quasiparticles_ acting like _Weyl fermions_

- In some cases, _electron bands_ can be _degenerate_, meeting at _points_
- _Near_ the points, _quasiparticles_ can be detected, and _described by the Dirac/Weyl equations_
- If the quasiparticle behaves as a _Weyl fermion_, the point is known as the _Weyl point_

## Dirac semimetals
- Example: _graphene_, with a crossing between $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ bands
- Both bands are _linearly dispersed_ at the crossing
- The crossing happens since the bands have _different irreducible representations_

- As long as there is _inversion_ $(i)$ and _time_ $(T)$ symmetry, each band is _two-fold_ degenerate
- Counting spin, there is _four-fold_ degeneracy at the Dirac point

- _Time-reversal_ symmetry means the material is _non-magnetic_
	- Around the point, _opposite wave-vectors_ on the Fermi surface have _opposite spins_
	- As $k$ rotates around the surface, _spin rotates with it_

## Weyl semimetals
- The bands are _spin-split_, and are hence _singly degenerate_
- Hence, the _crossing_ is _two-fold degenerate_

- If _spin-up_ and _spin-down_ bands cross, this makes the Weyl point _chiral_
- They are _topological defects_ analagous to _magnetic monopoles_
	- The analagous "magnetic field" is known as _Berry curvature_, and the points act as _sources and sinks_ depending on chirality

- Unlike other solids, which have _closed Fermi surfaces_, Weyl semimetals have _Fermi arcs_ which _terminate_ at Weyl points:
![[Weyl arc.png]]
- Hence, if an arbitrary surface has an _odd number_ of crossings with a Fermi surface, that Fermi surface belongs to a _Weyl semimetal_

- In order for there to be a Weyl crossing, _either_ inversion or time-reversal symmetry must be _broken_
	- _Non-centrosymmetric_ materials: via the _Dreelhaus_ effect (related to S-OC), making Weyl points appear _away from high-symmetry lines_
	- _Breaking $T$ symmetry_: applying a _magnetic_ field
- Weyl points always appear in _pairs_ of opposite chirality or monopole charge

- A Fermi surface _enclosing_ a Weyl point will have a _well-defined Chern number_

- Generally, Weyl points are _stable_ w.r.t small perturbations in _parameters of the Hamiltonian_
- They can only disappear upon _annihilation with another Weyl point_
