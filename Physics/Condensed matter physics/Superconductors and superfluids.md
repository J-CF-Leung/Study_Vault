# Overview
## Phenomenology
- Superconducting/superfluid phase: a _thermodynamically ordered phase_
	- Phase transition: a _specific heat anomaly_ due to loss in entropy

- Superfluid flow at _finite temperature_: a _two-component model_
	- Superfluid density $n_s$ is non-zero for $T<T_{c}$
	- $n_{s}\leq n$ (total density), equality for $T=0$

- Superconductors act as _diamagnets_, producing _surface currents_ when exposed to an _external magnetic field_, such that the field is _expelled_
- This is the _Meissner effect_
- For some $H<H_{c}(T)$ (critical external field), the superconductor is a _perfect diamagnet_, so there is _no internal field_
- For $H>H_{c}(T)$, the superconductor may then become a _normal solid_
	- Known as a _type-I superconductor_

- In some superconductors, there is a _lower critical field_ $H_{c1}(T)$ such that for $H>H_{c1}(T)$, the field _only partially penetrates_
	- It is a _vortex lattice state_
- Then above some $H_{c2}(T)$, the material goes back to a _normal state_

- For a type-I superconductor with a _cavity_, the _flux in the cavity is quantised_ in terms of _flux quanta_
$$\phi_{0}=\frac{hc}{2e}=\frac{h}{2e}$$
- As the _external field goes to zero_, the _flux is still trapped_ to give a _persistent current_
- In a type-II superconductor, the _vortices_ each trap _one flux quantum_

## Bosonic systems
- At low temperatures, $N$ bosons in a volume $V$ will undergo [[Advanced statistical mechanics#Bose-Einstein condensation at low temperatures|Bose-Einstein condensation]] at some temperature:
$$k_{B}T_\text{0}=\frac{2\pi \hbar^{2}}{m}\left( \frac{N}{2.6V} \right)^{2/3}$$
- Below this temperature, the _lowest energy eigenstate_ $\varphi_{0}$ has a _temperature-dependent macroscopic occupation_, known as the _condensate_
	- Lowest energy eigenstate: $p=0$ for an ideal gas system
$$N_{0}(T)=N\left[ 1-\left( \frac{T}{T_{0}} \right)^{3/2} \right]$$
- The _entropy_ of the system comes from the _thermally excited particles_, giving the distinction of _normal fluid_ and _superfluid_ (the condensate)

- Occupation of the _lowest energy state_ indicates some _macroscopic long-range order_
- Can be seen using [[Theories of Quantum Matter#Single particle density operator|single-particle density operator]], averaged:
	- Also known as _off-diagonal long range order_
$$\rho(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{x}')\equiv \langle \psi(\boldsymbol{x})\psi ^{\dagger}(\boldsymbol{x}) \rangle = N_{0}\varphi_{0}(\boldsymbol{x})\varphi_{0}(\boldsymbol{x}')+g(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}')$$
- The second term represents the contribution of _short-ranged order_, as it contains terms from _excited states_
	- Short range: typically within de Broglie wavelength at temperature $T$
- As the lowest energy state, $\varphi_{0}(\boldsymbol{x})$ has a _long length-scale_
