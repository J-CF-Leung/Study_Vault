- Soft matter is matter that is often _deformed_ by _thermal fluctuations and mechanical stresses_

- The tendency to deform is determined by $E$, the _elastic modulus_
- Given _pressure_ $p=F/A$ and _strain_ $\delta L/L$:
$$E=\frac{p}{\delta L/L}$$
- Deformation under _atomospheric pressure_ $10^{5}\,\text{Pa}$
	- _Diamond_ has $E=1.2\times 10^{11}\,\text{Pa}$, which gives _strain_ $8\times 10^{-7}$
	- _Rubber_ has $E\sim 10^{7}\,\text{Pa}$, which gives strain $1\times 10^{-2}$
	- _Gelatin_ has $E\sim 10^{3}\text{Pa}$, which gives strain $100$
		- The strain is _no longer small_, hence the _elastic regime breaks down_

- The elastic modulus can be thought of _characteristic energy per characteristic volume_
- The characteristic energy is the _binding energy per atom_
- The characteristic volume is the _volume per atom_

- Given _thermal fluctuations_ $\sim k_{B}T$, the relevant _length scale_ $(k_{B}T/E)^{1/3}$ is typically _much larger than atomic spacing_
- Hence, _quantum effects are irrelevant_, and _all fluctuations are thermal_

- The _scaling behaviour_ of polymers are typically _independent of atomic composition_
- They also have both _viscous_ and _elastic_ properties
- They can also _self-assemble_ into structures
