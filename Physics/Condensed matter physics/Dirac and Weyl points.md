- The _Weyl equation_, a _simplified_ version of the _Dirac equation_
- _Weyl fermions_:
	- Massless
	- Are _chiral_
	- _Not observed_ in _high-energy_ experiments

- _Weyl semimetals_: containing _quasiparticles_ acting like _Weyl fermions_

- In some cases, _electron bands_ can be _degenerate_, meeting at _points_
- _Near_ the points, _quasiparticles_ can be detected, and _described by the Dirac/Weyl equations_
- If the quasiparticle behaves as a _Weyl fermion_, the point is known as the _Weyl point_
