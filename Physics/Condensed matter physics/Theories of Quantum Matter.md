- _Simple_ quantum models of _many-body_ systems

- Actual Hamiltonian for atoms and electrons solid:
$$H=-\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\nabla_{j}^{2} +\dots$$
- Find a _many-electron_ wavefunction
- Intractable for $N\sim N_{A}$

- Requirement for _simple models_ with solutions for $N\to \infty$ that produce physical behaviour
- Tools from [[Second quantisation|second quantisation]] and quantum field theory are needed to represent wave functions
