- Electron-ion Hamiltonian:
$$H=-\sum_{i}\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2m}+\sum_{i}\frac{P_{i}^{2}}{2M_{i}}-\sum_{i,j} \frac{Z_{i}e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{1}{|\boldsymbol{R}_{j}-\boldsymbol{r}_{i}|}+\sum_{j<i} \frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{1}{|\boldsymbol{r}_{i}-\boldsymbol{r}_{j}|}+\sum_{j<i}\frac{Z_{i}Z_{j}e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{1}{|\boldsymbol{R}_{i}-\boldsymbol{R}_{j}|}$$

- _Approximations_ used:
	- Independent electron approximation
	- Hartree-Fock
	- Density Functional Theory
	- Fermi Liquid Theory

- _Phenomenological_ models are useful for reproducing physical behaviour
	- Ising model/Heisenberg Hamiltonian (ferromagnetism)
	- BCS Hamiltonian (super-conductivity)

- Complex phenomena often _emerge_ from a few simple rules

- _Elementary excitations_: excitations of a many-particle system that _cannot be thought of as combinations of lower energy excitations_
- Can be described using _linear response theory_
- Types: _quasi-particles_, and _collective excitations_

- _Quasi-particle_: Elementary excitation thought of as a _non-interacting particle with modified dispersion relation_
	- Map non-interacting particle + Fermi sphere into an _interacting system_, still end up with Fermi sphere + quasiparticle
	- Examples: interacting electrons, heavy fermions, Cooper pairs

- _Collective excitations_: not easily described in a particle picture, often have _macroscopic_ degrees of freedom
	- Example: _phonons_, the general vibrational state of _atoms_ is a superposition of phonons
	- Example: _magonons_ (spin waves)
	- Example: _plasmons_ (electron density oscillations)

- Collective excitations result from _symmetry breaking_
- The _ground state_ often _breaks_ the symmetry of the Hamiltonian
	- Example: aligned spins in ferromagnet is _not isotropic_, while the Hamiltonian should have $SU(2)$ symmetry
	- Example: _solids_ can have crystal structures that break the symmetry of the Hamiltonian
- Symmetry-breaking ground states are _meta-stable_
	- True ground state is a _coherent superposition_

- The _presence_ of _broken symmetry states_ implies _phase transitions_ at temperature $T_c$
	- Symmetries _cannot change continuously_
	- At $T>T_c$, increase in _entropy_ drives transition to a disordered state
	- At $T<T_c$, the broken symmetry state is _weakened by elementary excitations_
	- States characterised by _order parameter_
- For a _broken continuous symmetry_, there must be _long wavelength elementary excitations_ in the system, with _vanishing energy_

- Characteristic _energy scales_:
	- $1\text{ eV}$ per atom - Optical absorption energies, Bonding energies, Plasmon energies
	- $10-100\text{ meV}$ per atom - Optical phonon energies, Exchange energy in ferromagnets, Activation energy for dopants in semiconductors
	- $1-10\text{ meV}$ per atom - Acoustic phonons, Exchange energies in more weakly coupled magnetic systems, Energy of the excitation gap in high $T_c$ superconductors
	- $<1\text{ meV}$ per atom - Energy gap in conventional superconductors

- Room temperature: $k_{B}T \sim 25\text{ meV}$
- At $4\text{ K}$: $k_{B}T \sim 0.3\text{ meV}$
