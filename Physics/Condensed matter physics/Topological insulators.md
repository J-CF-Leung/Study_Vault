- Topological insulators: they _insulate on the inside_, and _conduct on the surface_

- There is a _spin current_, as the _electron spin depends on the current direction_

- The presence of special _surface states_ is dependent on the _topology of the band structure_
- Quantum states of the electrons are _knotted_ to produce _topologically ordered states_
- The resulting states are _protected_ so they _cannot be eliminated_ by disorder or chemical processes

## From quantum Hall effect to topological insulators
- A similar _2D_ phenomenon is the existence of [[Quantum Hall Effect|quantum Hall states]]
	- The _cyclotron motion_ caused by the field has _quantised energies_ leading to an _energy gap_
	- However, there are _edge states_ with a _skipping motion_, and a _continuous energy spectrum_

	- The _one-way_ flow is _perfect_, and has _no scattering_

- For topological insulators, the _spin-orbit coupling_ is analagous to the magnetic field

- The simplest _2D toplogical insulator_ has _quantum spin Hall states_
- For the _edge states_, the _spin-up_ and _spin-down_ electrons must propagate in _opposite directions_
- Similar to quantum Hall states, they are _immune from backscattering_
- The state is _time-reversal symmetric_
	- It switches both _propagation and spin direction_, hence _interchanging_ the modes

- In the _3D topological insulator_, the _surface states_ roughly resemble the _edge states in 2D_
- The _direction of motion_ now varies _continuously_ as a function of spin direction
