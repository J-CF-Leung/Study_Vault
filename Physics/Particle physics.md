- The study of _elementary particles_ and their interactions
- Described using the _standard model_

- _Atoms_ are _electrons_ bound to _nuclei_ with an EM force, of binding energy $\sim 10\,\text{eV}$
	- Size $\sim 10^{-10}\,\text{m}$
- _Nuclei_ are bound together by the _strong nuclear force_, of binding energy $\sim 10\,\text{MeV}$
	- Size $\sim 5\times10^{-15}\,\text{m}$
- _Nucleons_ are _quarks_ bound together by the strong force, of binding energy $\sim 1\,\text{GeV}$
	- Mass of nucleons $m_{p}\approx1836m_{e}$

- _Energies_:
	- Nuclear energies in $\text{keV, MeV}$
	- Particle energies in $\text{GeV, TeV}$
- _Masses_: $\text{MeV/}c^{2}$
	- Electrons: $0.511\text{ MeV/}c^{2}$
- _Atomic masses_: atomic mass units
	- $1\,\text{u}=931.5\text{ MeV/}c^{2}$
- _Cross-sections_: barns
	- $1\text{ b}=10^{-28}\,\text{m}^{2}$

- _Natural units_:
$$\displaylines{\hbar=c=\mu_{0}=\epsilon_{0}=1 \\ [E]=[p]=[M]=[L]^{-1}=[T]^{-1}=\text{MeV}}$$

- The latter two also makes _electric charge dimensionless_
- The _fine structure constant_:
$$\alpha=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar c}\sim \frac{1}{137}$$
- This gives:
$$e\sim 0.30$$
# Matter: Fermions
- All matter is made of _spin_$-1/2$ fundamental particles
- There are two types: _leptons_ and _quarks_
	- Leptons: _electron, muon, tauons_, with corresponding _neutrinos_
	- Quarks: _up_, _down_, _top_, _bottom_, _strange_, _charm_
- They each have three _generations_
- Each particle has a corresponding _antiparticle_
	- Due to the _Dirac equation_
	- Identical _mass, spin, energy_
	- _Opposite sign_ for interactions (e.g. electric charge)

## The three generations
- The _first generation_: Electron, electron neutrino, up quark, down quark

| Particle   | Symbol      | Type   | Charge$/e$ |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Electron   | $\ce{ e- }$ | Lepton | -1         |
| Neutrino   | $\nu_{e}$   | Lepton | 0          |
| Up quark   | $\ce{ u }$  | Quark  | $+2/3$     |
| Down quark | $\ce{ d }$            | Quark       | $-1/3$           |

- The _proton_ and _neutron_ are the _lowest energy bound states_ for a system of _three quarks_
	- _Proton_: $\ce{ uud }$
	- _Neutron_: $\ce{ udd }$

- There are two other _generations_:

| 1st generation              | 2nd generation            | 3rd generation            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Electron $\ce{ e- }$        | Muon $\ce{ \mu- }$        | Tau $\ce{ \tau- }$        |
| Electron neutrino $\nu_{e}$ | Muon neutrino $\nu_{\mu}$ | Tau neutrino $\nu_{\tau}$ |
| Up quark $\ce{ u }$         | Charm quark $\ce{ c }$    | Top quark $\ce{ t }$      |
| Down quark $\ce{ d }$       | Strange quark $\ce{ s }$  | Bottom quark $\ce{ s }$                          |

- Each generation is a _replica_ of the last, but with _increasing mass_
- They are _distinct particles_
	- i.e. Not excited states

## Leptons
- _Leptons_ are fermions that _do not interact via the strong interaction_
- _All_ experience the _weak force_

- Each _charged lepton_ $\ce{ e-,\mu-,\tau- }$ have a corresponding _neutrino_ (which are _neutral_)
- The _electron_ is quite stable, while the _muon_ and _tauon_ are _unstable_

- _Neutrinos_ will _only experience the weak force_
- They are _stable_ and _almost massless_

## Quarks
- Quarks experience _all forces_ (strong, EM, weak)
- Each generation has quarks with charges of $+2/3$ and $-1/3$ _respectively_:
$$\begin{pmatrix}u \\ d\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}c\\s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}t\\b\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}+2/3 \\ -1/3\end{pmatrix}$$
- They are either _up-type_ or _down-type_
- There are also _anti-quarks_ of opposite charge
- The _top quark_ is the _heaviest_ ($173\,\text{GeV}/c^{2}$, same as _gold nucleus_) 

- They also come with _colour charge_ (Red, green, blue)
- They label charge for the _strong interaction_
- The three colours are _orthogonal_

- They are always _confined_ within _hadrons_
- _Mesons_ are bound states of a _quark_ and _antiquark_
	- $\pi^{+}$: $(u\bar{d})$
	- $\pi^{-}$: $(\bar{u}d)$, _antiparticle_ of $\pi^{+}$
	- $\pi^{0}$: $(u\bar{u}+d\bar{d})/\sqrt{ 2 }$, its _own antiparticle_
- _Baryons_ are bound states of _three quarks_
	- _Proton_ $p$: $(udu)$
	- _Neutron_ $d$: $(dud)$

## Nuclei
- A _nucleus_ is a bound state of $Z$ protons and $N$ neutrons
- The _mass number_ $A=Z+N$
- A _nuclide_ $^{A}_{Z}X$ is a nucleus specified by $Z$ and $N$
- Isotones, isobars, isotopes:
![[tonesbartopes.png|300]]

- _Elements_ are classified according to $Z$
	- The _chemical properties_ are given by electron number (neutral: $=Z$)
	- Only $\ce{ H,He,Li }$ are from the _Big Bang_
	- Elements up to $\ce{ Fe }$ are from _stars_
	- Elements up to $\ce{ U }$ are from _supernovae_
- Nuclides:
![[Nuclides.png]]
- Higher $Z$ tend to need _more neutrons_ to be stable
- Very _neutron rich_ unstable nuclides decay be $\beta$ decay

# Forces: Bosons
- In _classical mechanics_, forces arise via _action at a distance_
- In _quantum mechanics_, fields are _quantised_
	- Example: [[Quantum electrodynamics|quantisation of the electromagnetic field]]
- Forces arise through the _exchange of virtual field quanta_ (gauge bosons)
- This typically _violates_ energy and momentum conservation
	- Meaning of _virtual_
- In a _short time_, it is permissible by the _uncertainty principle_:
$$\Delta E\Delta t\sim \hbar\implies c\Delta t\sim \hbar \frac{c}{\Delta E}$$
- Hence, a _larger energy transfer_ has a _smaller range_

- The _gluon_ is responsible for the _strong nuclear force_
	- There are _8_ gluons due to the $SU(3)$ symmetry
- The _photon_ is responsible for the _electromagnetic force_
- The _W and Z bosons_ are responsible for the _weak force_
	- Strength: $10^{}$
- The _graviton_ is responsible for _gravity_
	- It is by far the _weakest_ force, with a strength of $10^{-39}$ of the strong force

- Gauge bosons are _spin 1 particles_ (exceot the graviton)
- The _W and Z bosons_ are the _only bosons with mass_
- The standard model _does not include gravity_

- The _maximum range_ of a force is _inversely related_ to the _mass_ of the exchanged bosons:
$$c\Delta t\sim \hbar \frac{c}{\Delta E}\sim \frac{\hbar}{mc}$$
![[fundamental force ranges.png|400]]
- At _large distances_, only _bound states themselves_ interact, and they exchange _pions_ instead of _gluons_

## Symmetries and conservation
- [[Analytical classical mechanics#Symmetries and Noether's Theorem|Noether's Theorem]]: Every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law

- _Time translation_ symmetry leads to _energy conservation_
- _Spatial translation/rotation_ symmetry leads to _linear/angular momentum conservation_

- _Lorentz invariance_ leads to $(CPT)$, or _charge parity time_ symmetry
- _Gauge invariance_ leads to _charge conservation_
	- Charges: electric, colour, weak charges

# Particle kinematics
- In _nuclear reactions_, they are typically of _low kinetic energy_ $\sim 10\text{ MeV}\ll m_\text{nucleon}$
	- Exception: _beta decay_
- In _particle physics_, reactions are _relativistic_, $\sim 100\,\text{GeV}\gg m_\text{particle}$

- Most particles and nuclei are _unstable_, and _decays_ give its properties
- Not all decays are _allowed_ due to conservation laws

- Particle _scattering_ involves the _production_ of new massive particles
## Relativistic kinematics
- The _Minkowski metric_:
$$ds^{2}=dt^{2}-|d\boldsymbol{x}|^{2}\hspace{1.5cm}g_{\mu \nu}=\text{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$$

- Relativistic _energy and momenta_:
$$E=\gamma m\hspace{1.6cm}|\boldsymbol{p}|=\gamma m\boldsymbol{\beta}\hspace{1.5cm}\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-\beta^{2} }}$$
- Energy-momentum relation:
$$E^{2}=p^{2}+m^{2}$$
- When a particle is at rest, $E=m$
- When a particle is massless, $m=0$, $E=|\boldsymbol{p}|$
- When a particle is _ultra-relativistic_, $E\gg m$, $E\sim|\boldsymbol{p}|$

- The _kinetic energy_:
$$T=E-m=(\gamma-1)m$$

- Kinematics expressed as a _four-vector_:
$$x^{\mu}=(t,\boldsymbol{x})\hspace{1cm}x_{\mu}=(t,-\boldsymbol{x})$$
- The _spacetime interval_ is invariant:
$$\Delta s^{2}=t^{2}-|\boldsymbol{x}|^{2}=g_{\mu \nu}x^{\mu}x^{\nu}$$
- 4-momentum:
$$p^{\mu}=(E,\boldsymbol{p})$$
- The _rest mass is invariant_:
$$m^{2}=E^{2}-|\boldsymbol{p}|^{2}=g_{\mu \nu}p^{\mu}p^{\nu}$$
- For a _system of particles_, the invariant quantity is:
$$M_{X}^{2}=\left( \sum_{i}E_{i} \right)^{2}-\left( \sum_{i} \boldsymbol{p}_{i}\right)^{2}$$
- $M_X$ is _not necessarily the sum of rest masses_

## Particle decays
- Most particles have _finite lifetimes_
- The _number of particles_ must decay:
$$N(t)=N_{0}\exp(-\lambda t)$$
- The _rate of decay_:
$$\frac{dN}{dt}=-\lambda N$$
- The _activity_ $A=|dN/dt|=\lambda N$ for a _single particle_

- The _half-life_:
$$\exp(-\lambda \tau_{1/2})=\frac{1}{2}\implies \tau_{1/2}=0.693\tau$$

- One often finds _decay chains_
$$N_{1}\to$$
- Example: $\ce{ ^{235}U->^{231}Th->^{231}{Pa} }$
- - The _activity_ of the daughter:
$$A_{2}=\lambda_{2}N_{2}$$
- The _rate of decay_:
$$\frac{dN_{2}}{dt}=-\lambda_{2}N_{2}+\lambda_{1}N_{1}$$
- A decay is a _transition_ from one quantum state into another
- It is given by [[Time-dependent quantum mechanics#Fermi's Golden Rule|Fermi's Golden Rule]]:
$$\Gamma(i\to f)=\lambda=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2}\rho(E_{f})$$
- $M_{fi}$ is the _transition matrix element_
- $\lambda \,dt$ is the _probability_ a particle will decay in time $dt$
	- $\lambda$ is the _transition rate_
- $\rho(E_{f})$ is the _final density of state_

- Derive exponential decay law

- Average lifetime

- A _finite lifetime_ gives an _uncertain energy_ $\Delta E$
- Decaying states correspond to a _range of energies_:
$$\tau\,\Delta E\sim \hbar$$
- Consider a state _formed_ at $t=0$ with _energy_ $E_{0}$ and _mean lifetime_ $\tau$
- The _frequencies_ in the wavefunction is given by the _Fourier transform_ of $\psi(t)$:
$$f(\omega)=f(E)=$$
- The _probability_ of finding a state in energy $E$ is then:

- This is a _Lorentzian shape_
- The _full-width at half maximum_ is simply $\Gamma=\lambda$:
$$P(E=E_{0})=4\tau^{2}\hspace{1.5cm}P\left( E=E_{0}\pm\frac{\Gamma}{2} \right)=\frac{1}{2}(4\tau^{2})$$

- Particles often decay with _more than one decay mode_
	- Only one decay mode: $\ce{ \mu- ->e- + \bar{\nu}_{e}+\nu_{\mu} }$
$$\ce{ Z-> }$$

- They all have _partial decay rates_

- This determines an _average lifetime_
- Although the probabilities have _different heights_, they _all have the same total width_

- The _proportion of decays_ to a particular mode is the _branching fraction_
