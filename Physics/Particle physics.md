- The study of _elementary particles_ and their interactions
- Described using the _standard model_

- _Atoms_ are _electrons_ bound to _nuclei_ with an EM force, of binding energy $\sim 10\,\text{eV}$
	- Size $\sim 10^{-10}\,\text{m}$
- _Nuclei_ are bound together by the _strong nuclear force_, of binding energy $\sim 10\,\text{MeV}$
	- Size $\sim 5\times10^{-15}\,\text{m}$
- _Nucleons_ are _quarks_ bound together by the strong force, of binding energy $\sim 1\,\text{GeV}$
	- Mass of nucleons $m_{p}\approx1836m_{e}$

- _Energies_:
	- Nuclear energies in $\text{keV, MeV}$
	- Particle energies in $\text{GeV, TeV}$
- _Masses_: $\text{MeV/}c^{2}$
	- Electrons: $0.511\text{ MeV/}c^{2}$
- _Atomic masses_: atomic mass units
	- $1\,\text{u}=931.5\text{ MeV/}c^{2}$
- _Cross-sections_: barns
	- $1\text{ b}=10^{-28}\,\text{m}^{2}$

- _Natural units_:
$$\displaylines{\hbar=c=\mu_{0}=\epsilon_{0}=1 \\ [E]=[p]=[M]=[L]^{-1}=[T]^{-1}=\text{MeV}}$$

- The latter two also makes _electric charge dimensionless_
- The _fine structure constant_:
$$\alpha=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar c}\sim \frac{1}{137}$$
- This gives:
$$e\sim 0.30$$
# Matter: Fermions
- All matter is made of _spin_$-1/2$ fundamental particles
- There are two types: _leptons_ and _quarks_
	- Leptons: _electron, muon, tauons_, with corresponding _neutrinos_
	- Quarks: _up_, _down_, _top_, _bottom_, _strange_, _charm_
- They each have three _generations_
- Each particle has a corresponding _antiparticle_
	- Due to the _Dirac equation_
	- Identical _mass, spin, energy_
	- _Opposite sign_ for interactions (e.g. electric charge)

## The three generations
- The _first generation_: Electron, electron neutrino, up quark, down quark

| Particle   | Symbol      | Type   | Charge$/e$ |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Electron   | $\ce{ e- }$ | Lepton | -1         |
| Neutrino   | $\nu_{e}$   | Lepton | 0          |
| Up quark   | $\ce{ u }$  | Quark  | $+2/3$     |
| Down quark | $\ce{ d }$            | Quark       | $-1/3$           |

- The _proton_ and _neutron_ are the _lowest energy bound states_ for a system of _three quarks_
	- _Proton_: $\ce{ uud }$
	- _Neutron_: $\ce{ udd }$

- There are two other _generations_:

| 1st generation              | 2nd generation            | 3rd generation            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Electron $\ce{ e- }$        | Muon $\ce{ \mu- }$        | Tau $\ce{ \tau- }$        |
| Electron neutrino $\nu_{e}$ | Muon neutrino $\nu_{\mu}$ | Tau neutrino $\nu_{\tau}$ |
| Up quark $\ce{ u }$         | Charm quark $\ce{ c }$    | Top quark $\ce{ t }$      |
| Down quark $\ce{ d }$       | Strange quark $\ce{ s }$  | Bottom quark $\ce{ s }$                          |

- Each generation is a _replica_ of the last, but with _increasing mass_
- They are _distinct particles_
	- i.e. Not excited states

## Leptons
- _Leptons_ are fermions that _do not interact via the strong interaction_
- _All_ experience the _weak force_

- Each _charged lepton_ $\ce{ e-,\mu-,\tau- }$ have a corresponding _neutrino_ (which are _neutral_)
- The _electron_ is quite stable, while the _muon_ and _tauon_ are _unstable_

- _Neutrinos_ will _only experience the weak force_
- They are _stable_ and _almost massless_

## Quarks
- Quarks experience _all forces_ (strong, EM, weak)
- Each generation has quarks with charges of $+2/3$ and $-1/3$ _respectively_:
$$\begin{pmatrix}u \\ d\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}c\\s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}t\\b\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}+2/3 \\ -1/3\end{pmatrix}$$
- They are either _up-type_ or _down-type_
- There are also _anti-quarks_ of opposite charge
- The _top quark_ is the _heaviest_ ($173\,\text{GeV}/c^{2}$, same as _gold nucleus_) 

- They also come with _colour charge_ (Red, green, blue)
- They label charge for the _strong interaction_
- The three colours are _orthogonal_

- They are always _confined_ within _hadrons_
- _Mesons_ are bound states of a _quark_ and _antiquark_
	- $\pi^{+}$: $(u\bar{d})$
	- $\pi^{-}$: $(\bar{u}d)$, _antiparticle_ of $\pi^{+}$
	- $\pi^{0}$: $(u\bar{u}+d\bar{d})/\sqrt{ 2 }$, its _own antiparticle_
- _Baryons_ are bound states of _three quarks_
	- _Proton_ $p$: $(udu)$
	- _Neutron_ $d$: $(dud)$

## Nuclei
- A _nucleus_ is a bound state of $Z$ protons and $N$ neutrons
- The _mass number_ $A=Z+N$
- A _nuclide_ $^{A}_{Z}X$ is a nucleus specified by $Z$ and $N$
- Isotones, isobars, isotopes:
![[tonesbartopes.png|300]]

- _Elements_ are classified according to $Z$
	- The _chemical properties_ are given by electron number (neutral: $=Z$)
	- Only $\ce{ H,He,Li }$ are from the _Big Bang_
	- Elements up to $\ce{ Fe }$ are from _stars_
	- Elements up to $\ce{ U }$ are from _supernovae_
- Nuclides:
![[Nuclides.png]]
- Higher $Z$ tend to need _more neutrons_ to be stable
- Very _neutron rich_ unstable nuclides decay be $\beta$ decay

# Forces: Bosons
- In _classical mechanics_, forces arise via _action at a distance_
- In _quantum mechanics_, fields are _quantised_
	- Example: [[Quantum electrodynamics|quantisation of the electromagnetic field]]
- Forces arise through the _exchange of virtual field quanta_ (gauge bosons)
- This typically _violates_ energy and momentum conservation
	- Meaning of _virtual_
- In a _short time_, it is permissible by the _uncertainty principle_:
$$\Delta E\Delta t\sim \hbar\implies c\Delta t\sim \hbar \frac{c}{\Delta E}$$
- Hence, a _larger energy transfer_ has a _smaller range_
![[Bosons.png]]
- The _gluon_ is responsible for the _strong nuclear force_
	- There are _8_ gluons due to the $SU(3)$ symmetry
- The _photon_ is responsible for the _electromagnetic force_
- The _W and Z bosons_ are responsible for the _weak force_
	- Strength: $10^{}$
- The _graviton_ is responsible for _gravity_
	- It is by far the _weakest_ force, with a strength of $10^{-39}$ of the strong force

- Gauge bosons are _spin 1 particles_ (exceot the graviton)
- The _W and Z bosons_ are the _only bosons with mass_
- The standard model _does not include gravity_

- The _maximum range_ of a force is _inversely related_ to the _mass_ of the exchanged bosons:
$$c\Delta t\sim \hbar \frac{c}{\Delta E}\sim \frac{\hbar}{mc}$$
![[fundamental force ranges.png|400]]
- At _large distances_, only _bound states themselves_ interact, and they exchange _pions_ instead of _gluons_

## Symmetries and conservation
- [[Analytical classical mechanics#Symmetries and Noether's Theorem|Noether's Theorem]]: Every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law

- _Time translation_ symmetry leads to _energy conservation_
- _Spatial translation/rotation_ symmetry leads to _linear/angular momentum conservation_

- _Lorentz invariance_ leads to $(CPT)$, or _charge parity time_ symmetry
- _Gauge invariance_ leads to _charge conservation_
	- Charges: electric, colour, weak charges

## Parity
- Consider _parity operator_, which performs _spatial inversion_:
$$\hat{P}\ket{\psi(\boldsymbol{r},t)}=\ket{\psi(-\boldsymbol{r},t)}  $$
- The eigenvalue is known as _parity_:
$$P=\pm 1$$
- If the _Hamiltonian_ for the interaction _commutes_ with $\hat{P}$, parity is _conserved_:
$$\left[ \hat{P},\hat{H} \right]=0$$
- Parity is _conserved_ in QED and QCD, but _violated_ for the _weak force_
# Particle kinematics
- In _nuclear reactions_, they are typically of _low kinetic energy_ $\sim 10\text{ MeV}\ll m_\text{nucleon}$
	- Exception: _beta decay_
- In _particle physics_, reactions are _relativistic_, $\sim 100\,\text{GeV}\gg m_\text{particle}$

- Most particles and nuclei are _unstable_, and _decays_ give its properties
- Not all decays are _allowed_ due to conservation laws

- Particle _scattering_ involves the _production_ of new massive particles
## Relativistic kinematics
- The _Minkowski metric_:
$$ds^{2}=dt^{2}-|d\boldsymbol{x}|^{2}\hspace{1.5cm}g_{\mu \nu}=\text{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$$

- Relativistic _energy and momenta_:
$$E=\gamma m\hspace{1.6cm}|\boldsymbol{p}|=\gamma m\boldsymbol{\beta}\hspace{1.5cm}\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-\beta^{2} }}$$
- Energy-momentum relation:
$$E^{2}=p^{2}+m^{2}$$
- When a particle is at rest, $E=m$
- When a particle is massless, $m=0$, $E=|\boldsymbol{p}|$
- When a particle is _ultra-relativistic_, $E\gg m$, $E\sim|\boldsymbol{p}|$

- The _kinetic energy_:
$$T=E-m=(\gamma-1)m$$

- Kinematics expressed as a _four-vector_:
$$x^{\mu}=(t,\boldsymbol{x})\hspace{1cm}x_{\mu}=(t,-\boldsymbol{x})$$
- The _spacetime interval_ is invariant:
$$\Delta s^{2}=t^{2}-|\boldsymbol{x}|^{2}=g_{\mu \nu}x^{\mu}x^{\nu}$$
- 4-momentum:
$$p^{\mu}=(E,\boldsymbol{p})$$
- The _rest mass is invariant_:
$$m^{2}=E^{2}-|\boldsymbol{p}|^{2}=g_{\mu \nu}p^{\mu}p^{\nu}$$
- For a _system of particles_, the invariant quantity is:
$$M_{X}^{2}=\left( \sum_{i}E_{i} \right)^{2}-\left( \sum_{i} \boldsymbol{p}_{i}\right)^{2}$$
- $M_X$ is _not necessarily the sum of rest masses_

## Particle decays
- Most particles have _finite lifetimes_
- The _number of particles_ must decay:
$$N(t)=N_{0}\exp(-\lambda t)$$
- The _rate of decay_:
$$\frac{dN}{dt}=-\lambda N$$
- The _activity_ $A=|dN/dt|=\lambda N$ for a _single particle_

- The _half-life_:
$$\exp(-\lambda \tau_{1/2})=\frac{1}{2}\implies \tau_{1/2}=0.693\tau$$

- One often finds _decay chains_
$$N_{1}\xrightarrow{\lambda_{1}}N_{2}\xrightarrow{\lambda_{2}}N_{3}$$
- Example: $\ce{ ^{235}U->^{231}Th->^{231}{Pa} }$
- The _activity_ of the daughter:
$$A_{2}=\lambda_{2}N_{2}$$
- The _rate of decay_:
$$\frac{dN_{2}}{dt}=-\lambda_{2}N_{2}+\lambda_{1}N_{1}$$

### Decay rates and lifetimes
- A decay is a _transition_ from one quantum state into another
- It is given by [[Time-dependent quantum mechanics#Fermi's Golden Rule|Fermi's Golden Rule]]:
$$\Gamma(i\to f)=\lambda=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2}\rho(E_{f})$$
- $M_{fi}$ is the _transition matrix element_
- $\lambda \,dt$ is the _probability_ a particle will decay in time $dt$
	- $\lambda$ is the _transition rate_
- $\rho(E_{f})$ is the _final density of state_

- The probability that the particle _decays_ at time interval $t$ to $t+dt$ is $p(t)\lambda dt$, hence the probability that it _survives_ is $p(t+dt)=p(t)(1-\lambda dt)$
- From this, one gets:
$$p(t)=\exp(-\lambda t)$$

- The _average lifetime_ of a particle is then:
$$\tau=\langle t \rangle =\int t\,\left(p(t) \lambda\,dt\right)=\frac{1}{\lambda} $$

### Distribution of energies
- A _finite lifetime_ gives an _uncertain energy_ $\Delta E$
- Decaying states correspond to a _range of energies_:
$$\tau\,\Delta E\sim \hbar=1$$
- Consider a state _formed_ at $t=0$ with _energy_ $E_{0}$ and _mean lifetime_ $\tau$:
$$|\psi(t)|^{2}=|\psi(0)|^{2}\exp\left( -\frac{t}{\tau} \right)\implies \psi(t)=\psi(0)\exp\left( -iE_{0}t \right)\exp\left( -\frac{t}{2\tau} \right)$$
- The _frequencies_ in the wavefunction is given by the _Fourier transform_ of $\psi(t)$:
$$f(\omega)=f(E)=\frac{i\psi(0)}{(E_{0}-E)-i/(2\tau)}$$
- The _probability_ of finding a state in energy $E$ is then:
$$p(E)=|f(E)|^{2}=\frac{|\psi(0)|^{2}}{(E_{0}-E)^{2}-1/4\tau^{2}}$$

- This is a _Lorentzian shape_
	- The _Breit-Wigner peak_
- The _full-width at half maximum_ is simply $\Gamma=\lambda$:
$$P(E=E_{0})=4\tau^{2}\hspace{1.5cm}P\left( E=E_{0}\pm\frac{\Gamma}{2} \right)=\frac{1}{2}(4\tau^{2})$$
![[Breit-Wigner peak.png|300]]

- Particles often decay with _more than one decay mode_
	- Only one decay mode: $\ce{ \mu- ->e- + \bar{\nu}_{e}+\nu_{\mu} }$
$$\ce{ Z-> e+e- or \mu+\mu-}$$

- They all have _partial decay rates_:
$$\lambda_{f}=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2}\rho(E_{f})\hspace{1.5cm}\lambda=\sum_{f}\lambda_{f}$$

- This determines an _average lifetime_:
$$\tau=\frac{1}{\lambda}$$
- The _total width_ of a particle state:
$$\Gamma=\lambda=\sum_{f}\lambda_{f}=\sum_{f}\Gamma_{f}$$
- The _proportion of decays_ to a particular mode is the _branching fraction_:
$$B_{f}=\frac{\Gamma_{f}}{\Gamma}\hspace{1.5cm}\sum_{f} B_{f}=1$$

## Reactions and cross-sections
- An interaction between two particles is a case of _scattering_

- _Elastic scattering_ has the _same particles_ in the initial state and final state
	- Only their _momenta_ change
$$\ce{ a + b -> a + b }$$
- _Inelastic scattering_ has _different particles_ in the initial state and final state:
$$\ce{ a +b -> c +d }$$

### Reaction cross-section
- The _strength_ of the reaction is specified by the _cross-section_
- It is the _effective area_ presented to the _incoming particle_
- Unit: _barn_
$$1\sigma=10^{-28}\,\text{m}^{2}$$

- It is the _reaction rate per target particle_ $\Gamma$, _per unit incident flux_ $\Phi$
	- Flux: number of incoming particles _per unit area per second_
$$\Gamma=\Phi\sigma$$

### Beam attenuation
- Consider a _beam_ of area $A$ with $N$ particles, on a _target_ of $n$ nuclei per unit volume, with _thickness_ $dx$
![[Scattering beam to target.png|300]]
- The _number of target nuclei_ is $N_{T}=nA\,dx$
- The _effective area_ for absorption is $\sigma N_{T}$
- The _incident flux_ is $N/A$
- Therefore, the _number of particles scattered per unit time_ is:
	- This can be used to _find_ $\sigma$
$$-dN=\frac{N}{A} \sigma nA\,dx\implies \sigma=-\frac{dN}{nN\,dx}$$
- One can _integrate_ to find the _beam attenuation_ in a target of thickness $L$:
$$N=N_{0}\exp(-\sigma nL)$$
- The beam attenuates _exponentially_

- For a _thin target_, $N_{0}\sigma nL$ particles are _scattered_
- The _mean free path_ between interactions is $1/n\sigma$
	- Often referred to as the _interaction length_

### Differential cross-section
- The _angular distribution_ of the scattered particles is _not necessarily uniform_
	- Can be considered in _position_ or _momentum space_
- The _number of particles_ scattered in some _solid angle_ $d\Omega$ is:
$$dN_{d\Omega}=d\sigma\, \Phi N_{T}$$
- The _differential cross-section_ is then:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{dN_{d\Omega}}{\Phi N_{T}\times d\Omega}$$
- This is the _number of particles scattered per unit time per unit angle_, divided by the _incident flux times the number of target particles_

- This is _more feasible_ to measure as one does not have to _cover_ the $4\pi$ solid angle

- It provides _more information_ about the reaction

- For a set of particles, there can be _different final states_
	- Example: $\ce{ e+e- -> \gamma }\text{ or }\ce{ Z }$
- One can define _partial cross-sections_ for final state $i$:
$$\sigma=\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}$$
## Relativistic Born Approximation
- Consider a _beam of relativistic particles_ scattering from a _fixed potential_ $V(\boldsymbol{r})$:
	- Different from the [[Quantum scattering theory|purely quantum case]]
![[Particle scattering geometry.png|300]]
- There is a _momentum transfer_
	- Natural units: $\boldsymbol{p}=\boldsymbol{k}$
$$\boldsymbol{q}=\boldsymbol{p}_{f}-\boldsymbol{p}_{i}$$
- The _scattering rate_ is characterised by the _interaction cross-section_:
	- The cross-section is _number of scattered particles per unit time_, divided by the _incident flux_
$$\sigma=\frac{\Gamma}{\Phi}$$
- The transition rate is given by [[Time-dependent quantum mechanics#Fermi's Golden Rule|Fermi's Golden Rule]]:
$$\Gamma=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2}\rho(E_{f})$$
- _Approximate_ the _unperturbed_ wave function as a _normalised plane wave_:
$$\psi_{\boldsymbol{k}}=\frac{1}{L^{3/2}}\exp[i(\boldsymbol{p}\cdot \boldsymbol{r}-Et)]$$
- This gives the _matrix element_:
$$M_{fi}=\braket{ \psi_{f}|V|\psi_{i}  }= \frac{1}{L^{3}}\int \exp(-i\boldsymbol{q}\cdot \boldsymbol{r}) V(\boldsymbol{r})\, d^{3}\boldsymbol{r}  $$
- The _incident flux_ for a beam with _number density_ $n$ and _velocity_ $v_{i}$:
$$\Phi=nv_{i}=\frac{v_{i}}{L^{3}}$$
- As for the _density of states_, consider the _particle in a box_ (neglecting spin):
$$dN=\frac{1}{(2\pi/L)^{3}}d^{3}\boldsymbol{p}=\left( \frac{L}{2\pi} \right)^{3}p^{2}\,dp\,d\Omega$$
- For a _relativistic particle_, $E^{2}=p^{2}+m^{2}$
- This gives the _density of states in energy_:
$$\rho(E)=\frac{dN}{dE}=\left( \frac{L}{2\pi} \right)^{3}pE\,d\Omega$$
- The approximation is for an _ultra-relativistic particle_

- This gives the _differential cross-section_:
	- _Different_ from the [[Quantum scattering theory#The Born Approximation|quantum case]]
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{2}v_{i}}\left| \int \exp(-i\boldsymbol{q}\cdot \boldsymbol{r})V(\boldsymbol{r}) \, d^{3}\boldsymbol{r}  \right|^{2}p_{f}E_{f} $$
- For _relativistic scattering_, $v_{i}\approx 1$ and $E\approx p$:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{E^{2}}{(2\pi)^{2}} \left| \int \exp(-i\boldsymbol{q}\cdot \boldsymbol{r})V(\boldsymbol{r}) \, d^{3}\boldsymbol{r}  \right|^{2}$$
### Relativistic Rutherford scattering
- Consider _relativistic Coulomb scattering_
	- A special case of the _Yukawa potential_ $V(r)=g\exp(-mr)/r$ with $g=Z\alpha$ and $m=0$
$$V(\boldsymbol{r})=-\frac{Ze^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}=-\frac{Z\alpha}{r}$$
- For _scattering angle_ $\theta$, one can derive:
$$q^{2}=4E^{2}\sin^{2}\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)$$
- This gives the _differential cross-section_:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{Z^{2}\alpha^{2}}{4E^{2}\sin^{4}(\theta/2)}$$
## Resonant scattering
- Particle interactions can take place via a _resonant state_, which then _decays_:
$$\ce{ a +b->Z^{*}->c +d }$$
- This is a _two stage picture_:
	- _Formation_ occurs when the _collision energy_ $E_\text{CM}$ is _approximately_ equal to the _natural frequency_ (mass) of $\ce{ Z^{*} }$ 
	- _Decay_ is _independent_ of the mode of formation and depends _only_ on tha nature of $\ce{ Z^{*} }$, and there can be _multiple decay modes_

- The _resonance cross-section_:
$$d\sigma=\frac{1}{\Phi}2\pi |M_{fi}|^{2}\rho(E_{f})$$
- The _density of states_ is _fixed_ by only _one particle_, as _energy conservation_ fixes the energy of the other:
$$\rho(E_{f})=\left( \frac{L}{2\pi} \right)^{3}p^{2} \frac{E}{p}\,d\Omega=\left( \frac{L}{2\pi} \right)^{3} \frac{p_{f}^{2}}{v_{f}}\,d\Omega$$
- This gives the differential cross-section:
	- Redefine the matrix element in order to _cancel_ the $L^{3}$ factor
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{p_{f}^{2}}{(2\pi)^{2}v_{i}v_{f}}\left| M_{fi} \right|^{2} $$
- The matrix element is given by _second order perturbation theory_:
	- The [[Time-dependent quantum mechanics#A general Hamiltonian|second order coefficient]]
	- The effects are _large_ as $E-E_{Z}$ is _small_
$$M_{fi}=\sum_{Z}\frac{M_{iZ}M_{Zf}}{E-E_{Z}}$$
- The sum _runs over all intermediate states_
	- Near _resonance_, only one state contributes _significantly_

- Consider the _intermediate state_:
$$\psi_{Z}(t)=\psi_{Z}(0)\exp(-iE_{0}t)\exp\left( -\frac{t}{2\tau} \right)=\psi_{Z}(0)\exp\left[ i\left( E_{0}-i\frac{\Gamma}{2} \right)t \right]$$
- Therefore, the state has _energy_ $E_{0}-i\Gamma/2$, and the matrix element is:
$$\left| M_{fi} \right|^{2}=\frac{|M_{iZ}|^{2}|M_{Zf}|^{2}}{(E-E_{0})^{2}+\Gamma^{2}/4} $$
- The rates of _decay_ and _formation_:
	- $\Gamma_{i\to Z}=\Gamma_{Z\to i}$
$$\begin{align}\Gamma_{i\to Z}&=2\pi \left| M_{iZ} \right|^{2}\rho(E_{i})=|M_{iZ}|^{2} \frac{p_{i}^{2}}{\pi v_{i}} \\ \Gamma_{Z\to f}&= 2\pi|M_{Zf}|^{2} \rho(E_{f})=|M_{Zf}|^{2} \frac{p_{f}^{2}}{\pi v_{f}}\end{align}$$
- This gives the _Breit-Wigner (resonance) cross-section_:
$$\sigma=\frac{\pi g}{p_{i}^{2}} \frac{\Gamma_{i\to Z}\Gamma_{Z\to f}}{(E-E_{0})^{2}+\Gamma^{2}/4}$$
- The factor $g$ accounts for _spin_:
$$\ce{ a +b->Z^{*}->c +d }\hspace{1.25cm}g=\frac{2J_{Z}+1}{(2J_{a}+1)(2J_{b}+1)}$$
- This the _ratio_ of the number of _$Z^{*}$ spin states_ to the _total number of $\ce{ a+b }$ spin states_
	- Probability that $\ce{ a+b }$ collide in the _correct spin state_ to form $Z^{*}$

- $\sigma$ is a _frame-independent quantity_
	- $p_{i}$ must be calculated in the _centre of mass frame_
	- If the target is _heavy_, $p_{i}$ is approximately the _lab momentum_
- $E$ is the _total energy_, and $\Gamma$ is the _total decay rate_
	- $\Gamma_{i\to Z}$ and $\Gamma_{Z\to f}$ are the _partial decay rates_

- The _total cross-section_:
$$\sigma _\text{tot}=\sum_{f} \sigma(i\to f)$$
- The _total decay rate_ $\Gamma$ must be used for the denominator in the Breit-Wigner formula

- The _elastic cross-section_:
	- In this case, $\Gamma_{i}=\Gamma_{f}$
$$\sigma _\text{el}=\sigma(i\to i)$$
- At the _peak of resonance_:
$$\displaylines{\sigma _\text{peak}=\frac{4\pi g\Gamma_{i}\Gamma_{f}}{p_{i}^{2}\Gamma^{2}} \\ \sigma _\text{el}=\frac{4\pi gB_{i}^{2}}{p_{i}^{2}} \hspace{1cm}\sigma _\text{tot}=\frac{4\pi gB_{i}}{p_{i}^{2}}\hspace{1cm}B_{i}=\frac{\Gamma_{i}}{\Gamma}=\frac{\sigma _\text{el}}{\sigma _\text{tot}}}$$
- Hence, one can _cancel_ $B_{i}$ and _infer_ $g$, and the _spin_ of the _resonant state_

- One can _produce the same resonance_ from _different initial states_:
![[Resonances.png|500]]

# Colliders
- Consider the _collision_ of two particles
- The _invariant quantity_:
$$\begin{align}
s=E_\text{CM}=(p_{1}+p_{2})^{2}=(E_{1}+E_{2})^{2}-(\boldsymbol{p}_{1}+) \\
\end{align}$$
- $\sqrt{ s }$ gives the _highest amount of energy available for particle collision_

## Causing a collision
- A _fixed target collision_ has a particle hitting another _stationary_ particle
- For the _ultrarelativistic regime_ $E_{1}\gg m_{1},m_2$, this gives $\sqrt{ s }\sim \sqrt{  }$
- A typical experiment gives a mass energy of $30\text{ GeV}$
	- A lot of energy contributes to _momentum for the final state_

- A _collider experiment_ has _moving particles collide head-on_
- In the ultra-relativistic regime, $\sqrt{ s }\sim$
- A typical experiment gives a mass energy of $900\text{ GeV}$
- The final state can be relatively _stationary_

- For high $E_\text{CM}$, one needs to _accelerate_ particles to high energy
- One can use a _voltage_, but the geometry is _linear_ and wastes space
- Instead, one can use _circular colliders_, with _magnetic fields_
	- It is limited by [[Electrodynamics and Optics#Synchotron radiation|synchotron radiation emission]]

## Particle detection
- After the collision event, a _detector_ needs to be used to deduce the final state

- _Trackers_ detect _ionisation_ using gas
	- Only works for _charged particles_
	- Example: cloud chambers
- For a tracker _in a magnetic field_, the particles _bend_
	- The _radius of curvature_ gives its _momentum_
	- Accuracy of detection $$\frac{\sigma_{p}}{p}\propto p$$
	- High momentum: high $R$, almost _straight_
	- _Lower momentum_ particles are _easier to measure accurately_

- _Calorimeters_ detect the _energy_ of the particle using _high-density absorbers_ and _scintillating material_ to collect energy
	- The high density material initiates a _particle shower_
	- It detects both _neutral and charged particles_
- The length scale of _nuclear interactions_ is _longer_ than that of _radiation_
- For _hadrons_, one needs _denser materials_ for the calorimeters
	- Particles go through the _electromagnetic_ calorimeter before the _hadronic_ calorimeter
- _Higher energy_ particles produce showers with _many particles_, giving _low uncertainty_
	- $\sigma_{E}/E \propto \sqrt{ N }/E=1/\sqrt{ E }$

- _Muons_ can typically move _through_ both detectors and calorimeters
- _Neutrinos_ require _specialised detectors_
![[Detector design.png]]

- Types of signals:
	- Hadrons: _charged_ ones leave tracks, all have heavy deposits in HCAL
	- Muons leave _tracks_, with small CAL deposits, but still _penetrate_
	- _Quarks_ manifest as _jets_ of hadrons due to _gluons_
	- _Taus_ typically _decay_ within the beam
![[Particle detection.png|400]]

# The standard model
- Particles include [[#Matter Fermions|fermions]] in _matter_, the [[#Forces Bosons|spin-1 bosons]] providing _forces_, and the _Higgs boson_, with _spin-0_ and generating _mass_

- The standard model is a collection of _gauge theories_ for _quantum fields_
	- They must satisfy _local gauge invariance_

 - _Quantum electrodynamics_ (QED) _quantises_ the electromagnetic fields
 - _Electroweak unification_ combined _electromagnetism_ and the _weak force_
 - _Quantum chromodynamics_ quantised the _strong force_

- The time-independent _Schrodinger equation_ for a _free particle_:
$$i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=-\frac{1}{2m}\nabla^{2}\psi$$
- It is _not Lorentz invariant_

- From special relativity:
$$E^{2}=p^{2}+m^{2}$$
- Substituting operators:
$$-\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial t^{2}}=-\nabla^{2}\psi+m^{2}\psi$$
- One can get _plane wave solutions_:
$$\psi=$$
- The _complete set_ of eigenstates gives _negative energy solutions_
	- Gives rise to concept of _antimatter_

- A _linear_ relativistic wave equation is the _Dirac equation_:
$$i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=(-i\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot \nabla+\beta m)\psi$$
- $\psi$ is a _spinor_ with four components
- Two of the components still have _negative energy_

## Antiparticles
- A plane wave solution dictates time dependence $\exp(-iEt)$, which would indicate _negative energy states_ propagating _backwards in time_
- However, making the simultaneous transformation $E\to -E$ and $t\to -t$:
$$\exp[-iEt]\equiv\exp[-i(-E)(-t)]$$
- Hence, a _negative energy particle_ corresponds to a _positive energy antiparticle_ travelling _forwards in time_

- Example: consider $\ce{ e- +\gamma -> e- +\gamma }$
![[Electron photon interactions.png]]
- The former has a _positive energy electron_ emitted as the photon has _less energy_ than the original electron
- The latter has the emission of a photon with _more energy_, and can be seen as:
	- _Emission_ of a _negative_ energy $\ce{ e- }$ travelling _backwards in time_
	- Or the _absorption_ of a _positive_ energy $\ce{ e+ }$ travelling _forwards in time_

## Interaction via particle exchange and the Yukawa potential
- Consider two particles _fixed_ at $\boldsymbol{r}_{1}$ and $\boldsymbol{r}_{2}$ which _exchange_ a particle of mass $m$
	- A _generic_ particle
![[Interaction particle exchange.png]]

- Yukawa theory postulates that it is due to _exchange of massive quanta_
- The _rate of momentum exchange_ then provides a _force_

- As the quantum carries _energy_, its existence is _transient_, with time duration given by:
$$\Delta E\Delta t\sim \hbar$$
- It is said to be _virtual_
### Using perturbation theory
- The _shift_ in energy of $i$ due to the exchange using _second order perturbation theory_:
$$\Delta E_{i}=\sum_{j\neq i} \braket{  |  } $$
- The sum is _over all possible momenta_

- Consider the transition $i\to j$ by emission of $m$ at $\boldsymbol{r}_{1}$:
$$\psi_{i}=\psi_{1}\psi_{2} \hspace{1.5cm}\psi_{j}=\psi_{1}\psi_{2}\psi_{3}$$
- Here, $\psi_{3}$ represents a _free particle_ with 4-momentum

- Let $g$ be the _probability_ of emitting $m$ at $\boldsymbol{r}_{1}$
$$\braket{  |  }= $$
- The factor $1/\sqrt{ 2E }$ is a _normalisation factor_

- Integrate over all momenta

- Using contour integration:
$$\Delta E_{i}^{1\to 2}=-\frac{g^{2}}{8\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$
- Consider an exchange from $2$ to $1$:
$$\Delta E_{i}^{2\to 1}=-\frac{g^{2}}{8\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$
- Therefore, the _total shift in energy_ due to particle exchange is given by the _Yukawa potential_:
$$\Delta E_{i}=-\frac{g^{2}}{4\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$
- The _characteristic range_ is $1/m$
	- The _Compton wavelength_ of the exchanged particle
- For $m\to 0$, this gives the _Coulomb potential_

### From the Klein-Gordon equation
- Describe the system using the _Klein-Gordon equation_:
$$\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial t^{2}}=\nabla^{2}\psi-m^{2}\psi$$
- Setting $m=0$, it is the _electromagnetic wave equation_ $(c=1)$
- $\psi$ is interpreted as the _amplitude_ of the associated _photon_, or as a [[Electrodynamics and Optics#Maxwell's equations in terms of potentials|potential]] $V(\boldsymbol{r})$

- To generalise, $m$ is the _mass of the boson_ responsible for the interaction
	- $0$ for photons and gluons
	- Non-zero for _gauge bosons_ $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$

- For a _static, spherically symmetric system_, one can solve _Poisson's equation_:
$$V(r)=-\frac{g^{2}}{4\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$
- Here, $-g^{2}$ is an _integration constant_ to match the formula from perturbation theory

## Scattering from the Yukawa potential
- Consider _elastic scattering_ from the _Yukawa potential_
- The _source_ of the potential has _coupling strength_ $g_{0}$
- The _scattered particle_ has coupling $g$, giving the potential:
$$V(r)=-\frac{g_{0}g}{4\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$

- The _3-momentum transfer_ is $\boldsymbol{p}$, and for elastic scattering, there is _no energy transfer_
- Define the _4-momentum transfer_ as:
$$q^{\mu}=(\Delta E,\boldsymbol{p})=(0,\boldsymbol{p})$$

- The Born approximation gives:
$$M_{fi}=-\frac{g_{0}g}{4\pi} \int \frac{1}{r}\exp(-mr-i\boldsymbol{p}\cdot \boldsymbol{r}) \, d^{3}\boldsymbol{r} $$

- Evaluating the _contour integral_:
$$M_{fi}=\frac{g^{2}}{q^{2}-m^{2}}$$
- Here, $q$ is the _invariant mass_ of 4-vector $q^{\mu}$
- It is interpreted as two _vertex factors_ $g_{0},g$, with the _propagator term_ $(q^{2}-m^{2})^{-1}$

### Virtual mass
- Forces arise due to the _exchange_ of the _virtual particle_ of mass $q$
	- They are _unobservable_ as the act of observation disrupts the interaction

- $q$ is known as the _virtual (off shell) mass_
	- It can be _positive_, _negative_, or _imaginary_
- It is _not necessarily equal to the physical (on shell) mass_ $m$

- A virtual particle with an _off-mass shell_ of $\Delta m=|q-m|$ can exist for:
$$\Delta t\sim\frac{1}{\Delta m}$$
- If $q^{2}=m^{2}$, the particle is _real and observable_

### The boson propagator
- Given a _set_ of possible interactions, which may consist of _multiple scattering processes_, the _matrix elements add up_:
$$M_{fi}=M_{1}+M_{2}+\dots=\sum_\text{interactions} \left( \prod g_{i} \right)\left( \prod \frac{1}{q^{2}-m^{2}} \right)$$

- The propagators $(q^{2}-m^{2})^{-1}$ are roughly _inversely proportional_ to _how off-shell the virtual mass is_
- The _more off-shell the virtual mass_, the more _difficult_ the probability of _creating the virtual state_, and the _smaller the contribution to the matrix element_
# Feynman diagrams
- Only the _initial and final states_ of a scattering process can be known
- Calculations depend on the _time ordering_ of absorptions and emissions
	- Using _time ordered perturbation theory_, dependent on the _reference frame_

- A _Feynman diagram_ represents the _sum of all time orderings_
- Each Feybman diagramn represents a _term in the perturbation theory expansion_
- A _full matrix element_ contains an _infinite number of Feynman diagrams_:
$$\displaylines{M_{fi}=M_{1}+M_{2}+\dots \\ \Gamma_{fi}=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2}\rho (E)}$$

- Each _vertex_ in a Feynman diagram contains a factor of $g$ from the [[#Interaction via particle exchange|Yukawa potential]]:
![[Feynman g factors.png]]
- The _approximate size_ of a matrix element is given by the _lowest order diagram_:
$$M_{fi}\sim \frac{\prod g}{q^{2}-m^{2}}$$

- Creation of _virtual particles_ must conserve mass and momentum
	- If it _only_ has the _real mass_, it is _not conserved_

## Pictoral representation of particles
- The _topological features_ of the diagram are associated with _terms in the matrix element_

- Representation of _particles_:
![[Feynman diagram lines.png|400]]

- _External_ lines for _real particles_:
![[Feynman external particles.png|400]]
- _Internal_ lines for _virtual particles_:
![[Feynman internal lines.png|550]]

## Vertices
- Each interaction has _different_ $g$
	- EM interaction: $g=Qe$
	- Weak interaction: $g=g_{W}$
	- Strong interaction: $g=\sqrt{ \alpha_{s} }$

- Each vertex typically has _three lines_
	- Examples: pair production, annihilation, emission

- Conserved quantities:
	- Energy
	- Momentum and angular momentum
	- Charge
	- Lepton number $(L_{e}=+1)$, minus for antiparticles
	- Baryon number $B=(n_{q}-n_{\bar{q}})/3$
	- Strangeness $S=-(n_{s}-n_{\bar{s}})$
	- Parity _except for weak interactions_

- Due to the _relative strengths_ of the fundamental forces, an interaction takes place via the _strong force_ as the _priority_, followed by _electromagnetic_, followed by _weak_
	- The stronger the interaction, the bigger the _contribution_ to the matrix element
### Electromagnetic interactions
- Vertices for _electromagnetic_ interactions must involve a _photon_ and _charged particles_
- Coupling strength $Qe$, where $Q$ is the _charge_
- One can have _triple gauge vertices_ involving _no fermions_ (from electroweak interaction)

### Weak interactions
- Vertices for _weak interactions_ must involve a _gauge vector boson_ $Z$ or $W^{\pm}$
- _Neutrinos_ can _only appear in weak interactions_
- Coupling strength $g_{W}$
- $W^{\pm}$ can _change quark flavour_, and also _cross quark generations_ (not lepton)
	- Same generation: Cabibbo favoured
	- Cross generation: Cabibbo suppressed
	- Cross two generations: Doubly Cabibbo suppressed
- The $Z$ boson _cannot change flavour_, and only _pair produces_
- From _lepton number conservation_, there are _no vertices connecting leptons to quarks_
- One can have _triple/quadruple gauge vertices_ from _self-interaction_
- There are often _spectator quarks_ as interactions happen in _hadrons_

### Strong interactions
- Vertices for _strong interactions_ must involve a _gluon_ $g$ and/or quark $q$
	- Interact with _colour charge_
	- Hence, _no interactions_ with neutrinos, photons, $Z$ and $W^{\pm}$ bosons
- Coupling strength $\sqrt{ \alpha_{s} }$
- Can also _self-interact_ to produce triple/quadruple gauge vertices

![[Example feynman diagrams.png]]

### s,t,u channels
- $s-$channel diagrams: _annihilatiom/pair production_
- $t-$channel diagrams: _exchanging_ virtual particles
	- Special case - $u-$channel: _identical_ particles in the final state, hence the it is _indistinguishable_ which vertex they came form
- Each case has _different propagators_ due to _differing virtual mass_

- If there are _two channels of the same order_, the _matrix elements add_

# Quantum electrodynamics
- QED is the _gauge theory_ of electromagnetic interactions
- The [[Quantum electrodynamics|quantisation]] of the _electromagnetic field_

- A _non-relativistic_ charged particle in an EM field:
$$\boldsymbol{F}=q(\boldsymbol{E}+\boldsymbol{v}\times \boldsymbol{B})$$
- Vector and scalar potentials:
$$\boldsymbol{E}=-\nabla \varphi-\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{A}}{\partial t}\hspace{1.5cm}\boldsymbol{B}=\nabla\times \boldsymbol{A}$$
- The _Hamiltonian_:
$$H=\frac{1}{2m}\left| \boldsymbol{p}-q\boldsymbol{A} \right|^{2}+q\varphi $$
- The Schrodinger equation:
$$H\psi=\left[ \frac{1}{2m}\left| \hat{\boldsymbol{p}}-q\boldsymbol{A} \right|^{2}+q\varphi(\boldsymbol{r},t)  \right]\psi(\boldsymbol{r},t)=E\psi(\boldsymbol{r},t)$$
- The _local gauge transformation_ (a $U(1)$ transformation):
$$\psi\to \exp(iq\alpha)\psi \hspace{1cm}\boldsymbol{A}\to \boldsymbol{A}+\nabla\alpha \hspace{1cm}\varphi\to \varphi-\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial t}$$
- Requires the existence of a _physical gauge field_
- There must also be a _conserved quantity_, given by _electric charge_ $q$
	- Related to the transformation itself

- The interaction is _quantised_ using massless _photons_
- It _couples_ with the invariant electric charge
- Each _vertex_ gives a _strength_ $\propto \sqrt{ \alpha }$

## Processes in QED
- The _standard electromagnetic vertex_:

- The _coupling_ is _proportional_ to the _electric charge_
- QED _never_ changes _particle type_ or _flavour_

- Compton scattering:
![[Compton scattering Feyman.png]]
$$M \propto \frac{g^{2}}{q^{2}}\propto e^{2} \propto \alpha \implies \sigma \propto \alpha^{2}$$
- _Bremsstrahlung_ and _pair production_ can only occur with the assistance of a _nucleus_
	- It is _kinematically impossible_ in vacuum
	- $M \propto Ze^{3}$

- _Electron-positron_ annihilation:
	- $M\propto Q_{q}e^{2}$
- _Pion decay_:
	- It _must_ occur via an electron/positron to _conserve angular momentum_
	- $M\propto Q_{u}^{2}e^{2}$
- $J/\psi$ decay:
	- The $J/\psi$ has _spin 1_, therefore decays _directly_
	- $M\propto Q_{c}e^{2}$

## Scattering processes in QED

### Electron-proton scattering
- Consider _electron-proton scattering_ in the $t-$channel
![[e-p scattering Feynman.png]]
- From the formula for [[#Relativistic Born Approximation]]:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{E^{2}}{(2\pi)^{2}}|M|^{2}$$
- The matrix element is given by:
$$M=\frac{e^{2}}{q^{2}}=\frac{4\pi\alpha}{q^{2}}$$
- $q$ represents the _4-momentum of the virtual photon_
- _Neglecting_ electron mass, one gets:
$$q^{2}=-2E_{i}E_{f}(1-\cos\theta)$$
- Hence for _elastic scattering_:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{\alpha^{2}}{4E^{2}\sin^{4}\theta/2}$$

- For _high_ $q$, results imply that the _scattering potential is not point-like_
- The scattering potential _resolves_ the _structure_ of the proton

### Electron-positron annihilation
- Consider _electron-positron annihilation_
![[e-e+ annihilation.png]]
- In the _centre of mass frame_, one gets $q^{2}=(2E)^{2}=s$
- This gives the cross-section:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{\alpha^{2}}{s}\implies \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{4\pi\alpha^{2}}{s}$$
- Taking the _spin states_ into account (to create a spin-1 photon):
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega }=\frac{\alpha^{2}}{4s}(1+\cos^{2}\theta) \implies \sigma=\frac{4\pi\alpha^{2}}{3s}$$

### Drell-Yan process
- The _annihilation_ of $q\bar{q}$ within _hadrons_
- Example: 
$$\ce{ \pi- p -> \mu+\mu- + \text{hadrons} }$$
![[p+pi Drell-Yan.png|500]]
- The cross-section:
$$\sigma \propto Q_{u}^{2}\alpha^{2}\propto Q_{u}^{2}e^{4} $$
- One must also account for the presence of _two_ $u$ quarks
## Experimental tests of QED
- Example: _magnetic moments_ of the electron and muon:
$$\boldsymbol{\mu}=\frac{ge}{2m}\boldsymbol{s}$$
- Dirac equation predicts that $g=2$

- However, _higher order terms_ introduce an _anomalous_ magnetic moment
![[Magnetic moment diagrams.png]]
- One must _sum over all possible diagrams for an order_
	- Example: $72$ for $O(\alpha^{3})$, $12672$ for $O(\alpha^{4})$

## Higher order diagrams
- Higher order diagrams for electron-positron-annihilation (non-exhaustive)
![[e+e- annihilation higher orders.png]]
- The _cross-section_ of the matrix elements is _supressed_ by $\alpha^{2}\approx 1/137^{2}$ each time

- Higher order contributions can interfere _constructively or destructively_
	- Electron-proton scattering: $M\sim -e^{2}+e^{4}$
	- Positron-proton scattering: $M\sim e^{2}+e^{4}$

## Running of QED interaction strength
- $\alpha=e^{2}/4\pi$ specifies the _strength_ of electromagnetic interactions

- However, it is _not a constant_
- _Quantum fluctuations_ around charges create a _cloud_ of _virtual_ $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs, which are then _polarised_, _screening_ the electric charge
	- Similar to the _screening_ of charges in a _dielectric medium_
![[Virtual particle charge screening.png]]
- At _large distances_, the bare electron charge is _sceened_
- For _shorter distances_, there is a _larger effective charge_ and hence larger $\alpha$

- Example: measurement of $\alpha(q^{2})$ from $\ce{ e+e- -> \mu+\mu- }$
	- $q^{2}\approx 0$: $\alpha\sim 1/137$
	- $q^{2}\approx (100 \text{GeV})^{2}$: $\alpha\sim 1/128$

- This is the _running_ of $\alpha$ with energy

# Quantum chromodynamics
- QCD is the _gauge theory_ of the _strong interaction_
- The _quantised_ unit is given by the _massless gluon_
- They couple to the _strong charge_

- The _gauge transformation_ in QCD:
$$\psi\to \exp[ig\boldsymbol{\lambda}\cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}(\boldsymbol{r},t)]\psi$$
- It is an $SU(3)$ transformation
	- $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ is eight $3\times 3$ matrices 
- It represents a _locally determined rotation of the colour state_
- The _invariance_ under $SU(3)$ gives _eight massless gauge bosons_ (gluons)
- Gluons can also _self-couple_ (they have colour charge)


- Only _quarks_ have the strong charge and can interact with the strong interaction
- The _strength_ of interaction $\propto \sqrt{ \alpha_{s} }$
- It is much _stronger_ than the [[#Quantum electrodynamics|electromagnetic interaction]]:
$$\alpha =\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi}\sim \frac{1}{137}\hspace{1.5cm}\alpha_{s}=\frac{g_{s}^{2}}{\pi}\sim 1$$

- A strong interaction vertex always _conserves_ energy, charge, momentum, angular momentum
- It can _never change quark flavour_
- It also _conserves parity_

## Colour charge
- The electromagnetic interaction has _electric charge_, a _conserved_ quantum number with a continuum of values
- The _strong_ interaction has _colour charge_

- It is a quantum number with _3 values_ labelled $\color{red}{\text{red}}$, $\color{blue}{\text{blue}}$ and $\color{green}{\text{green}}$ ($r,b,g$)
- Quarks carry _colour_ $r,b,g$
- _Anti-quarks_ carry _anti-colour_ $\bar{r},\bar{b},\bar{g}$

- _Colourless_ particles are either:
	- _Not made of quarks_ (e.g. leptons, $W,Z$ bosons)
	- _Equal parts_ $r,b,g$, such as _mesons_ with $(r\bar{r}+b\bar{b}+g\bar{g})/\sqrt{ 3 }$ or _baryons_ with $rbg$
- _Gluons_ do _not_ have equal parts of colour

## Gluons
- Gluons are _spin-1 massless bosons_, carrying a colour quantum number
- Typically, one may expect _nine gluons_, as each _colour_ pairs with an _anti-colour_
- However, as one can form _linear combinations_, one can form a _colourless_ gluon with colour $(r\bar{r}+b\bar{b} +g\bar{g})/\sqrt{ 3 }$
- From _convention_, the coloured gluons are:
$$r\bar{b}\;\;\; r\bar{g}\;\;\; g\bar{r}\;\;\; g\bar{b}\;\;\; b\bar{g}\;\;\; b\bar{r}\;\;\;\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}(r\bar{r}-b\bar{b})\;\;\;\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 6 }}(r\bar{r}+b\bar{b}-2g\bar{g})$$

- Example: consider the _scattering_ of a $\color{red}{\text{red}}$ quark from a $\color{blue}{\text{blue}}$ quark
- _Colour_ is exchanged at each _vertex_ and _overall_:
![[Red blue quark scattering.png|500]]

### Self-interactions
- As gluons _themselves_ carry colour charge, they can interact with _other gluons_:
![[Gluon self interaction.png|450]]
- Example: _gluon scattering_ $gg\to gg$, with _colour flow_:
$$\ce{ r\bar{g}+g\bar{b}-> r\bar{r}+r\bar{b} }$$
![[Gluon gluon scattering.png]]

## QCD potential and confinement

### The colour factor
- The QCD potential has the same _form_ to the QED potential, but with the _colour factor_:
$$V_{QCD}=-C \frac{\alpha_{s}}{r}$$
- For $q\bar{q}$ in a _colourless_ state in a _meson_, $C=4/3$
- For $q\bar{q}$ in a _colourless_ state in a _baryon_, $C=2/3$

- This arises as _more than one gluon_ can participate in the process $q\to qg$
- The colour factor can be obtained from _averaging over initial colour states_, then _summing_ over intermediate/final colour states

### Confinement
- The gluon interaction is _strong_ enough such that _quarks/gluons are always confined within hadrons_, and are _never observed alone_
![[QCD vs QED forces.png]]
- _Self-interaction_ of the gluons _squeeze_ the lines of force into a _narrow tube/string_
- It has an effective _tension_ which _stores energy_ as the quarks _separate_

- The _energy stored per unit length_ is _constant_, hence $V(r)\propto r$
- Therefore, the _energy_ required to _separate_ two quarks is _infinite_
- They are always _confined_ into combinations of _zero net colour charge_

### Quark and antiquark
- Between _quarks and antiquarks_, the potential consists of a _short range Coulomb-like term_, and a _long range linear term_:
$$V_{QCD}=-\frac{4}{3} \frac{\alpha_{s}}{r}+kr$$
- With $k\sim 1\,\text{GeV}/\text{fm}$
- At large $r$, $F\approx k$, approximately $1.6\times 10^{5}\,\text{N}$

## Jets
- Consider a $q\bar{q}$ pair _produced_ in $\ce{ e+e- -> q\bar{q} }$
![[Quark production.png|600]]
- As the quarks _separate_, the potential in the _colour field_ (string) _increases linearly_
- When the energy stored _exceeds_ $2m_{q}$, _new pairs_ can be created
- As energy _decreases_, the hadrons (mostly _mesons_) freeze out
![[Jet production.png|500]]

- As quarks _separate_ more, more $q\bar{q}$ pairs are _produced_
- This is known as _hadronisation_
- A pair of quarks can end as _narrowly collimated jets of hadrons_
- Jets _follow_ the direction of the _original_ (anti)quark
- Hence, detectors observe _pairs_ of back-to-back jets

## Nucelon-nucleon interactions
- _Bound_ $qqq$ states are _colourless_, or _singlet states_
- They can only _emit/absorb another_ colour _singlet state_
	- Simply from _conservation_

- They typically interact by the _exchange of pions_
	- Example: $pp$ scattering
![[Proton-proton scattering.png|600]]
- The nuclear potential is _Yukawa_:
$$V(r)=-\frac{g^{2}}{4\pi} \frac{\exp(-m_{\pi}r)}{r}$$
- It is a _short range force_, as $1/m_{\pi}=1.4\,\text{fm}$

## Running of QCD interaction strength
- Just like [[#Running of QED interaction strength|QED]], $\alpha_{s}$ which _specifies interaction strength_, is _not constant_ (dependent on energy)
- In QCD, there is a _colour screening_ effect
- Quantum _fluctuations_ lead to a _cloud_ of _virtual_ $q\bar{q}$ pairs
![[Virtual quark pairs.png|300]]

- As gluons can _self-interact_, there can also be a _cloud of virtual gluons_
	- There is _no analogue_ in QED as photons _do not self interact_
![[Virtual gluons.png|300]]
- These gluon self-interactions cause _bare colour charge_ to be _screened_ by both _virtual quarks and gluons_
- As the cloud _carries colour charge_, the _effective colour charge_ tends to _decrease_ at smaller distances (high energy)
	- Low energies: _large_ $\alpha_{s}$ (perturbation theory is less accurate)
	- High energies: _small_ $\alpha_{s}$, hence _quarks_ can be treated as _free particles_ (asymptotic freedom, perturbation theory can be used)
- This is known as _colour anti-screening_
![[QED running vs QCD.png]]

## Evidence for QCD

### Scattering experiments
- Consider high-energy _proton-proton scattering_
![[Proton proton scattering.png|500]]
- From the formula for _elastic cross-section_ for Rutherford scattering, $\alpha_{s}$ can be calculated

- Compare $\ce{ pp }$ and $\ce{ \pi+p }$ scattering:
![[pp or pip.png|600]]
- QCD _does not distinguish between flavour_, only _colour_ is relevant
- At _high energy_, the _ratio_ of cross sections depends on the _number of possible quark-quark combinations_:
$$\frac{\sigma(\pi p)}{\sigma(pp)}= \frac{2}{3}$$
- Consider $\ce{ e+e- }$ annihilation at high energy:
![[ee annihilation comparison.png]]
- Consider the _ratio_:
$$R=\frac{\sigma(\ce{ e- e+ -> \text{hadrons} })}{\sigma(\ce{ e- e+ -> \mu+ \mu- })}$$
- This must be _summed_ over all _flavours and colours_:
$$R=3\sum_\text{flavours} Q^{2}$$
- As the _centre of mass increases_, the number of _kinetically accessible quarks_ increases
- $R$ starts to _increase in steps_, as _heavier bound states_ are formed
	- Common bound atates: _quarkoniums_ $(q\bar{q})$

### Other evidence for colour
- The $\Omega^{-}$ is a _spin-_$3/2$ baryon consisting of $sss$ quarks
- As they have _identical spin and flavour_, and quarks are _fermions_, there must be an _additional quantum number_ (colour)
- It is an _antisymmetric superposition_ of $rgb$

- In the _Drell-Yan process_, the cross-section is _suppressed_ by $N_\text{colour}^{-2}$, as quarks of _matching colour_ must annihilate to form photons

### Evidence for gluons
- Like the radiation of _photons_ in QED, _gluons_ can be _radiated_ in QCD
$$\ce{ e+e- -> q\bar{q}g }$$
![[Gluon radiation.png|400]]
- The matrix element is now:
$$M \sim \frac{Q_{q}}{q^{2}}\sqrt{ \alpha }\sqrt{ \alpha }\sqrt{ \alpha_{s} }$$
- in QCD, gluons are _confined_
- They can be detected in _3-jet events_ such as the above

- The _angular distribution_ in jets gives that gluons are _spin-1_

### Evidence for gluon self-interactions
- Consider _4-jet events_
![[4 jet events.png|500]]
- The angular distribution is sensitive to _triple gluon vertices_
	- Due to a different combination of _spins_

# Hadrons
- Hadrons are _composite particles_ of multiple quarks

- The magnetic moments of protons and neutrons are _not of point-like particles_
	- Point-like: $e\hbar/2m_{p}$ and $0$ respectively
- At _high_ $q^{2}$, scattering _deviates from Rutherford scattering_
- Hadron _jets_ are observed in electron and proton scattering
## Hadron wavefunctions
- Quarks are always confined in _colourless states_ (colour _singlets_)
- _Mesons_ have a quark and antiquark
- _Baryons_ have three quarks

- Treat quarks as _identical fermions_ with the composite wavefunction:
$$\psi=\psi _\text{space}\psi _\text{flavour}\psi _\text{spin}\psi _\text{colour}$$
### Colour wave-functions
- They must form _singlets_
- Mesons:
$$\psi^{q\bar{q}}_\text{colour}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 3 }}(r\bar{r}+g\bar{g}+b\bar{b})$$
- Baryons:
$$\psi^{qqq}_\text{colour}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 6 }}(rg b+gbr+brg-rbg-grb-bgr)$$
### Parity
- A composite system of two particles with _orbital angular momentum_ $L$:
$$P=P_{1}P_{2}(-1)^{L}$$
- $P_{1,2}$ are _intrinsic parities_

- Fermions and their antiparticles have _opposite parity_
- Bosons and their antiparticles have _same parity_

- Quarks and leptons have $P_{q/l}=+1$
- _Gauge bosons_ have $P_{\gamma}=-1$ and $J^{P}=1^{-}$

- For _mesons_, $S=0,1$
	- $S=0$: pseudoscalar mesons
	- $S=1$: vector mesons
- For $L=0$, mesons have parity $-1$

- From considering _quark flavours_, there is a _psueodscalar nonet_ and _vector nonet_ of mesons

### Isospin and strangeness
- Isospin and strangeness of quarks:
$$I=\frac{1}{2}(n_{u}-n_{d}-n_{\bar{u}}+n_{\bar{d}})\hspace{1.5cm}s=\frac{1}{2}(n_{s}-n_{\bar{s}})$$
![[Quark isospin strangeness.png]]

## Light mesons
- Mesons of $I=s=0$ _mix_ to form $\pi^{0},\eta,\eta'$
- Mesons of $I=\pm 1$ and $s=0$ _mix_ to form $\pi^{\pm}$
- There is an _isospin triplet_ for the pions
- The $\eta$ particles form a _singlet_
![[Light meson nonets.png]]
- Isospin doublet: kaons with $I=\pm 1/2$
	- $K^{+}, K^{0}$ and $K^{-},\bar{K}^{0}$

### Zero flavour mesons
- The states $u\bar{u},d\bar{d},s\bar{s}$ have _zero flavour_, and can _mix_
	- Can form pseudoscalar or vector mesons
![[Zero flavour mesons.png]]
- Determine mixing coefficients from _masses_ and _decays_
- Example: decay of $\rho^{0}=(u\bar{u}-d\bar{d})/\sqrt{ 2 }$ at $J^{P}=1^{-}$
$$M(\rho^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-})\sim \frac{e}{q^{2}}\left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }} (Q_{u}e-Q_{d}e)\right]$$
### Meson masses
- Meson masses are only _partly from constituent quark masses_
	- $m(K)>m(\pi)$ suggests $m_{s}>m_{u},m_{d}$
	- $m(\rho)>m(\pi)$ despite having the same quarks

- Analagous to _hyperfine splitting_ in hydrogen
	- Due to magnetic field of the proton
- In QCD, there is a _colour magnetic interaction_:
$$M_{q\bar{q}}=m_{1}+m_{2}+A \frac{\boldsymbol{S}_{1}}{m_{1}}\cdot \frac{\boldsymbol{S}_{2}}{m_{2}}$$
- For spin:
$$\boldsymbol{S}_{1}\cdot \boldsymbol{S}_{2}=\frac{1}{2}(S^{2}-S_{1}^{2}-S_{2}^{2})=\frac{1}{2}S^{2}- \frac{3}{4}$$
- From this, $J^{P}=0^{-}$ mesons are _lighter_

![[Meson masses.png]]

## Baryons
- Made from three _indistinguishable quarks_
	- Flavour can simply be treated as another quantum number
- It must be _antisymmetric_ under interchange of _any_ 2 quarks
- Example: $\Omega^{-}(sss)$ has $L=0,J=3/2$ must have antisymmetric $\psi _\text{colour}$

- Consider only _ground states_ of $L=0$, therefore with a _symmetric $\psi _\text{space}$_
- As all hadrons are _colour singlets_ (antisymmetric), $\psi _\text{spin}\psi _\text{flavour}$ must be _symmetric_

### Spin wavefunctions
- Build up the _three particle_ spin function by _adding_ one spin to a two-spin wave function
![[Three quark spin wavefunctions.png]]

- Consider all quarks having the _same flavour_ $(\ce{ uuu,ddd,sss })$
- The spin must be _symmetric under any interchange_

- Two quarks of the same flavour

- All different flavours

- Baryons come in an _octet_ and _decuplet_
![[Quarks.png]]

- Masses

### Baryon magnetic moment
- The [[Charged Particles#Spin and the magnetic moment operator|magnetic moment]] arises from _orbital motion_ of charged quarks, as well as their _intrinsic spin-related magnetic moments_

 $$\hat{\mu}_{L} \hspace{1.5cm} \hat{\mu}_{S}$$

- The _scalar magnetic moment_ is the _maximum measurable component_ of the operator
- The _Bohr magneton_:
$$\mu_{B}= \frac{e\hbar}{2m_{e}}$$
- _Higher order corrections_:
$$\mu_{s}=-\mu_{B}\left[ 1+\frac{\alpha}{} +O(\alpha^{2}) \right]$$

- If the _proton and nuetron_ were point-like:
$$\mu_{L}= \hspace{1.5cm}\mu_{s}=$$
- $e\hbar/2m_{p}=\mu_{N}$ is the _nuclear magneton_

- The _observed_ $g-$factors are _different from that of point-like particles_

- Assume that the _bound quarks_ act as _point-like_ particles with _fractional charge_:
$$\mu_{u}= \frac{2}{3} \frac{e\hbar}{2m_{u}} \hspace{1cm}\mu_{d}= -\frac{1}{3} \frac{e\hbar}{2m_{d}} \hspace{1cm} \mu_{s}=-\frac{1}{3} \frac{e\hbar}{2m_{s}}$$

- For an $L=0$ barypn, the baryon magnetic moment is the _expectation value_ of the _sum_ of individual quark magnetic moments:
$$\hat{\mu}_\text{baryon}=\frac{q_{1}}{m_{1}} \hat{S}_{1z}+ \frac{q_{2}}{m_{2}} \hat{S}_{2z} + \frac{q_{3}}{m_{3}} \hat{S}_{3z}$$

## Hadron decays
- Hadrons decay via the _strong interaction_ to _lighter mass states_ if energetically possible
	- Examples: $\ce{ \rho^{0} -> \pi+\pi- }$ and $\ce{ \Delta^{++} -> p\pi+ }$
- _Angular momentum_ and _parity_ must be conserved

- They can also decay into _identical particles_
	- Examples: $\ce{ \omega^{0} -> \pi^{0}\pi^{0} }$ and $\omega^{0} \to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^{0}$

- They can also decay via the _electromagnetic interaction_, as a particle changes into a counterpart of _different spin_ by emitting a _photon_ 
	- Examples: $\ce{ \rho^{0} -> \pi^{0}\gamma }$ and $\Sigma^{0} \to \Lambda^{0}\gamma$
- _Angular momentum_ and _parity_ must be conserved

- The _lightest mass states_ such as $p,n,K^{\pm}$ must decay via the _weak_ interaction to change flavour
- _Parity_ is violated

## Quarkoniums

# The weak force
- The weak force accounts for _particle decays_
- Characterised by _long lifetimes_, and _small interaction cross-sections_
![[Lifetimes.png]]

- The weak interaction has two _types_, both mediated by _vector bosons_
	- The _charged current_, mediated by $W^{\pm}$ bosons $(m_{W}=80\,\text{GeV})$
	- The _neutral current_, mediated by $Z$ bosons $(m_{Z}=91\,\text{GeV})$
- They can produce _pairs_, which are _not particle/antiparticle_

- The $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons carry _weak charge_, and the former can carry _electric charge_
- This gives rise to _self interactions_
	- Triple and _quartic_ gauge vertices

## Fermi theory
- The weak interaction is taken as a _4-fermion contact interaction_
- There is _no propagator_
- The coupling strength is given by the _Fermi constant_ $G_{F}$
	- $G_{F}=1.166\times 10^{-5}\,\text{GeV}^{-2}$


- Example: beta decay
![[Fermi theory decay.png]]
- Example: neutrino scattering
![[Neutrino scattering Fermi.png]]
- From Fermi theory, the _cross-section_ is:
$$d\sigma=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2} \frac{dN}{dE}=8\pi G_{F}^{2} \frac{E_{e}^{2}}{(2\pi)^{3}}\,d\Omega$$
- From this, with _high enough centre-of-mass energy_, the cross-section _grows without bound_, eventually _violating probability conservation_
	- Probability conservation: the [[Quantum scattering theory#Differential cross-section|unitarity limit]]

- From this, Fermi theory _breaks down at high energies_
- It is an _effective field theory_ for _low energies_ $(q^{2}\ll m_{W}^{2})$
## Weak charged current
- At lower energy, interactions are mediated by _charged_ $W^{\pm}$ bosons
	- Due to the _high invariant mass_ of $W^{\pm}$, it gives a _small propagator_
![[Fermi theory vs standard model.png|550]]

- At _low energies_ $(q^{2}\ll m_{W}^{2})$, the propagator _approaches_ $1/(-m_{W}^{2})$
- This appears as the _point-like_ interaction of Fermi theory

- This gives a _range_ for the interaction:
$$\frac{1}{m_{W}}\sim 0.002\,\text{fm} $$

- The _charged current_ interaction is the _only interaction_ that can:
	- _Change flavour_
	- _Violate parity conservation_

- From the definitions of $g_{W}$ and $G_{F}$, at _low energies_:
$$\frac{g_{W}^{2}}{8m_{W}^{2}} \to \frac{G_{F}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}$$
- From measurements:
$$g_{W}=0.65 \implies \alpha_{W}=\frac{g_{W}^{2}}{4\pi}\sim \frac{1}{30} > \alpha$$
- The weak interaction is _intrinsically stronger_ than the electromagnetic interaction
- At _low energies_, it appears weak due to the _massive propagator_

- Consider _neutrino scattering_:
$$\displaylines{\frac{d\sigma _\text{Fermi}}{d\Omega}=2\pi G_{F}^{2} \frac{E_{e}^{3}}{(2\pi)^{3}} \\ \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=2\pi G_{F}^{2} \frac{E_{e}}{(2\pi)^{3}} \left( \frac{m_{W}^{2}}{m_{W}^{2}-q^{2}} \right)^{2}}$$
- Integrating, the _standard model_ cross-section is:
$$\sigma= \begin{cases}
G_{F}^{2}s/\pi &s\ll m_{W}^{2} \\ G_{F}^{2}m_{W}^{2}/\pi & s\gg m_{W}^{2}
\end{cases}$$
- The cross-section is _well-behaved_ at high energies

## Helicity and parity violation
- The _total angular momentum_ $\boldsymbol{J}=\boldsymbol{L}+\boldsymbol{S}$ is _conserved_
	- The _orbital_ angular momentum $\boldsymbol{L}$ is _perpendicular_ to $\boldsymbol{p}$
	- The _spin_ angular momentum $\boldsymbol{S}$ can be in _any direction_
- The _value_ of $\boldsymbol{S}$ _along_ $\boldsymbol{p}$ is always _constant_

- The _sign_ of the component of spin _along_ $\boldsymbol{p}$ is the _helicity_:
$$h=\boldsymbol{S}\cdot \frac{\boldsymbol{p}}{|\boldsymbol{p}|}$$
- A _positive(negative)_ helicity corresponds to _right(left)-handed_ particles
![[Right vs left helicity.png|450]]

- Wu experiment: the $\beta$ _decay_ of cold $\ce{ ^{60}Co }$ in a _magnetic field_
![[Wu experiment.png|400]]
- $\ce{ e- }$ is _always left-handed_, and $\ce{ \bar{\nu} }$ is _always right-handed_
- _Left-handed_ $\ce{ \nu }$ are _never observed_
- This is a _violation of parity_

- The weak interaction will _couple preferentially_ to _left-handed particles_, as well as _right-handed antiparticles_
- For a particle of $\pm$ helicity state, the _coupling_ to the _weak interaction_ is:
$$\frac{1}{2}\left[ 1\mp \frac{v}{c} \right]\;\text{ for leptons} \hspace{1cm}\frac{1}{2}\left[ 1 \pm \frac{v}{c} \right]\;\text{ for anti-leptons}$$
- From this: _right-handed_ $\nu$ and _left-handed_ $\bar{\nu}$ _do not exist_

- The weak force _does not always conserve parity_
	- The _only force_ that can violate it, QED and QCD _always conserve parity_
### Charge conjugation
- C-symmetry states that _physical laws_ must be _identical_ for _oppositely-charged particles_
	- Followed in QED and QCD
- Parity violation also leads to the _maximal breaking of C-symmetry_ by the weak force
![[C symmetry violation.png|500]]

## Weak vertices
- _All_ weak charged current interactions are described by the _weak vertex_, with the $W^{\pm}$ _boson propagator_:
![[Weak vertex.png|400]]
- $W$ bosons only _couple_ to leptons and neutrinos _in the same generation_
	- e.g. no $\ce{ W^{\pm}e^{\pm}\nu_{\mu} }$ coupling

![[Weak vertices examples.png]]

### Muon decay
- The _electromagnetic decay_ $\ce{ \mu- -> e- \gamma }$ is _impossible_
	- Electromagnetic interaction _cannot change flavour_
- The _weak charged current_ can change lepton type, but only _within a generation_
	- _Lepton number_ must still always be _conserved_
- Example:
![[Muon decay.png]]
- As $m_{\mu}\ll m_{W}$, [[#Fermi theory]] can be used as an approximation

- Fermi theory gives _Sargent's Rule_:
$$\Gamma_{\mu}=\frac{1}{\tau_{\mu}}=\frac{G_{F}^{2}}{192\pi^{3}}m_{\mu}^{5} \propto m_{\mu}^{5}$$
### Tau decay and lepton universality
- As $m_{\tau}>m_{\mu},m_{e},m_{p}\dots$ it has _several decay modes_
![[Tau decay modes.png]]

- One can hold _measurements_ of $g_{W}$ for both muon and tau decays
- The _coupling constant_ $g_{W}$ is _constant for all decays_
- This is known as _lepton universality_

- However, from measurement of decays to _hadrons_, $G_{F}$ is _different for quarks_

## Weak interactions for quarks
- It has been observed that _weak interactions_ with _quarks_ can _cross generations_
![[Kaon decay.png|450]]

### Quark mixing
- From this, _alter_ the generations:
$$\displaylines{\text{Leptons: }\begin{pmatrix}\ce{ e- } \\ \ce{ \nu_{e} }\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\ce{ \mu- } \\ \ce{ \nu_{\mu} }\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1.5cm}\text{Quarks: }\begin{pmatrix}\ce{ u }\\ \ce{ d' }\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}\ce{ c} \\ \ce{ s' }\end{pmatrix} \\ \begin{align}
d' &= d\cos\theta_{C}+s\sin\theta_{C} \\ s'&= s\cos\theta_{C}-d\sin\theta_{C}
\end{align}}$$

- The "down-type" quarks in the weak interactions are _linear combinations_ of down and strange
	- The _weak eigenstates_ $(d',s')$ are _superpositions_ of the _mass eigenstates_ $(d,s)$
$$\begin{pmatrix}d'\\ s' \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta_{C} & \sin\theta_{C} \\ -\sin\theta_{C} & \cos\theta_{C}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}d \\ s\end{pmatrix}$$

- Weak coupling to quarks is then:
![[Weak coupling to quarks.png]]

- From this, _compare_ muon decay and nuclear $\beta$ decay:
![[Muon vs beta decay.png]]
- The _ratio_ of $G_F$:
$$\frac{G_{F}^{\beta}}{G_{F}^{\mu}}=\cos\theta_{C}=0.974$$
- This is a _measurement_ of the Cabbibo angle, which is found to be $13^{\circ}$

### CKM matrix
- _Extend_ quark mixing to _three generations_
- The _approximate form_ of the matrix:
$$\displaylines{\pmatrix{d'\\s'\\b'}=V_\text{CKM}\pmatrix{d\\s\\b} \\ V_\text{CKM}=\pmatrix{V_\text{ud}&V_\text{us}&V_\text{ub} \\ V_\text{cd}&V_\text{cs}&V_\text{cb} \\ V_\text{td}&V_\text{ts}&V_\text{tb}} \sim \pmatrix{\cos\theta_{C}&\sin\theta_{C}&\sin^{3}\theta_{C}\exp(-i\delta) \\ -\sin\theta_{C}&\cos\theta_{C}& \sin^{2}\theta_{C} \\ \sin^{3}\theta_{C}\exp(-i\delta) &-\sin^{2}\theta_{C}&1}}$$
- The matrix is _unitary_
- The _mixing angle_ is still $13^{\circ}$, and the _C-P violating phase_ is $\delta\sim 69^{\circ}$:
	- A _hierarchy_ of values determined by "how off-diagonal" the term is
$$V_\text{CKM} \sim \pmatrix{0.975 & 0.220 & 0.01 \\ -0.220 & 0.975 & 0.05 \\ 0.01 & -0.05 & 1}$$
- Interactions in the _same family_ are _Cabbibo allowed_
- Interactions _differing by one family_ are _Cabbibo suppressed_
- Interactions _differing by two families_ are _doubly Cabbibo suppressed_

# Electroweak unification
- $W^{\pm}$ bosons _mediate_ the _weak charged current_, while also _coupling_ to $\gamma$
- Consider $\ce{ e- e+ -> W+ W- }$
![[Electron to W.png|550]]
- The cross-section for these diagrams _diverge_ at high energy

- Introduce the $Z$ boson
![[Z boson.png|350]]
- The $\gamma,W^{\pm}, Z$ couplings must be _related_
- This is _electroweak unification_

## Electroweak gauge theory
- Weak force from under the [[Classical Field Theory#Local phase (gauge) symmetry|gauge transformation]]:
$$\psi \to \psi'=\exp[ig\boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot \boldsymbol{\Lambda}(\boldsymbol{r},t)]\psi$$
- It is an $SU(2)$ transformation

- The state is characterised by _weak isospin_
	- A _rotation_ of the isospin state
- The invariance under $SU(2)$ gives _three massless gauge bosons_

- The gauge bosons have _well-specified couplings_, as well as _self couplings_
- This predicts that $W$ and $Z$ have the _same couplings_
	- _Experimental_ results say otherwise

- Instead, to _unify_ [[#Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] and the weak force, with a $SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ transformation
	- $U(1)$ operates on the _weak hypercharge_ $Y=2(Q-I_{3})$
	- $SU(2)$ operates on _weak isospin_ $I$

- The invariance gives _four massless gauge bosons_:
$$W^{+}, W^{-},W_{3},B$$
- The _neutral bosons_ $W_{3}$ and $B$ then _mix_ to form $Z$ and $\gamma$

- The _photon coupling_ must be the same as predicted in QED
- This enables _prediction_ of $Z$ coupling in terms of $g_{W}$ and $\gamma$

- $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ can _gain mass_ from the _Higgs mechanism_

## GWS model
- The EM and weak interactions are _manifestations of a unified electroweak force_
- The _mixing_ of neutral bosons:
$$\pmatrix{W^{+} \\ W_{3} \\ W^{-}}\;;\;B \to \pmatrix{W^{+} \\ Z \\ W^{-}} \;;\; \gamma$$
- Denoting the _field_ for the photon as $A$:
$$\begin{align}Z&= W_{3}\cos\theta_{W}-B\,\sin\theta_{W} \\ A&=B\cos\theta_{W}+W_{3}\sin\theta_{W} \end{align}$$
- $\theta_{W}$ is the _weak mixing angle_

- It makes _exact predictions_ of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ masses, with their _coupling parameters_
	- There are only _three given parameters_ $G_{F}$,$\alpha _\text{EM}$, $\theta_{W}$, which are _experimentally determined_
$$\alpha_{EM}=\frac{g_{EM}^{2}}{4\pi}=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi}\hspace{1cm} g_{W}=\frac{e}{\sin\theta_{W}}\hspace{1cm}g_{Z}=\frac{e}{\sin\theta_{W}\cos\theta_{W}}=\frac{g_{W}}{\cos\theta_{W}}$$

- The _masses_ given by Fermi theory and the Higgs mechanism:
$$\frac{G_{F}}{\sqrt{ 2 }}=\frac{g_{W}^{2}}{8m_{W}^{2}}\implies m_{W}=\sqrt{ \frac{\sqrt{ 2 }e^{2}}{8G_{F}\sin^{2}\theta_{W}} }\hspace{1cm}m_{Z}=\frac{m_{W}}{\sin\theta_{W}}$$

- Calculation of $Z$ coupling:


- The _discovery_ of neutral currents in $\ce{ \bar{\nu}_{\mu}e- -> \bar{\nu}_{\mu}e- }$ was _indirect evidence_ for $Z$
- The first _direct observation_ of $Z$ was in $p\bar{p}$ collisions, with the _decay products_ of $Z$

## Weak neutral current vertices
- $Z$ can _never_ change the _particle type, or quark/lepton flavour_
- It is a _mix_ of EM and weak couplings, therefore _depend_ on $\sin^{2}\theta_{W}$
	- $\theta_{W} \sim 29^{\circ}$

![[Neutral current vertices.png]]

- All standard model vertices with matter:
![[ST vertices with matter.png]]
## Z resonance
- Consider $\ce{ e+ e- -> q\bar{q} }$
- At _small energies_, the only contribution is the _photon propagator_
- At _higher energies_, the $Z$ boson also contributes

- At $\sqrt{ s }\sim m_{Z}$, the _Breit-Wigner resonance_ means that the $Z$ diagram dominates
	- $E_{CM}=\sqrt{ s }$, and $s=4E_{e}^{2}$
	- With $J_{Z}=1$ and $J_{e}=1/2$, $g=3/4$
$$\sigma(\ce{ e+e- -> Z -> f\bar{\text{f}} })= \frac{g\pi}{E_{e}^{2}} \frac{\Gamma_{ee}\Gamma_{f\bar{f}}}{(E_{CM}-E_{Z})^{2}+\Gamma^{2}/4}$$
- The _total decay width_:
$$\Gamma_{Z}=\Gamma_{ee}+\Gamma_{\mu \bar{\mu}}+\Gamma_{\tau \bar{\tau}}+\Gamma_{q\bar{q}}+\Gamma_{\nu \bar{\nu}}$$
- At the _peak of resonance_:
$$\sigma=\frac{12\pi}{m_{Z}^{2}} \frac{\Gamma_{ee}\Gamma_{f\bar{f}}}{\Gamma_{Z}^{2}}$$
- _Sum over_ all fermion/anti-fermion pairs ($\Gamma_{f\bar{f}}=\Gamma_{Z}$)
$$\sigma=\frac{12\pi}{m_{Z}^{2}} \frac{\Gamma_{ee}}{\Gamma_{Z}}$$
- Compare to the _QED cross-section_:
$$\frac{\sigma_{Z}}{\sigma_{QED}}=\frac{\sigma_{Z}}{4\pi\alpha^{2}/(3s)}\sim5700$$
- Therefore, $Z$ processes _dominate_ over QED processes at resonance

### Evidence for number of generations
- $\Gamma_{Z}$ includes partial widths for _all fermions_ with $m_{f}<m_{Z}/2$
- For a _fourth_ generation, the neutrino would be _light_, and also be produced at $Z$ resonance
	- Not observed directly, but will affect the _resonance curve_, by _increasing_ $\Gamma_{Z}$

- From _universality_ of lepton couplings, $\Gamma_{\nu \bar{\nu}}$ is _constant_ for each generation
