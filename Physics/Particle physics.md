- [ ] Revise using Ch. 1 and 2 of Perkins ðŸ”¼ 

- The study of _elementary particles_ and their interactions
- Described using the _standard model_

- _Atoms_ are _electrons_ bound to _nuclei_ with an EM force, of binding energy $\sim 10\,\text{eV}$
	- Size $\sim 10^{-10}\,\text{m}$
- _Nuclei_ are bound together by the _strong nuclear force_, of binding energy $\sim 10\,\text{MeV}$
	- Size $\sim 5\times10^{-15}\,\text{m}$
- _Nucleons_ are _quarks_ bound together by the strong force, of binding energy $\sim 1\,\text{GeV}$
	- Mass of nucleons $m_{p}\approx1836m_{e}$

- _Energies_:
	- Nuclear energies in $\text{keV, MeV}$
	- Particle energies in $\text{GeV, TeV}$
- _Masses_: $\text{MeV/}c^{2}$
	- Electrons: $0.511\text{ MeV/}c^{2}$
- _Atomic masses_: atomic mass units
	- $1\,\text{u}=931.5\text{ MeV/}c^{2}$
- _Cross-sections_: barns
	- $1\text{ b}=10^{-28}\,\text{m}^{2}$

- _Natural units_:
$$\displaylines{\hbar=c=\mu_{0}=\epsilon_{0}=1 \\ [E]=[p]=[M]=[L]^{-1}=[T]^{-1}=\text{MeV}}$$

- The latter two also makes _electric charge dimensionless_
- The _fine structure constant_:
$$\alpha=\frac{e^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}\hbar c}\sim \frac{1}{137}$$
- This gives:
$$e\sim 0.30$$
# Matter: Fermions
- All matter is made of _spin_$-1/2$ fundamental particles
- There are two types: _leptons_ and _quarks_
	- Leptons: _electron, muon, tauons_, with corresponding _neutrinos_
	- Quarks: _up_, _down_, _top_, _bottom_, _strange_, _charm_
- They each have three _generations_
- Each particle has a corresponding _antiparticle_
	- Due to the _Dirac equation_
	- Identical _mass, spin, energy_
	- _Opposite sign_ for interactions (e.g. electric charge)

## The three generations
- The _first generation_: Electron, electron neutrino, up quark, down quark

| Particle   | Symbol      | Type   | Charge$/e$ |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Electron   | $\ce{ e- }$ | Lepton | -1         |
| Neutrino   | $\nu_{e}$   | Lepton | 0          |
| Up quark   | $\ce{ u }$  | Quark  | $+2/3$     |
| Down quark | $\ce{ d }$            | Quark       | $-1/3$           |

- The _proton_ and _neutron_ are the _lowest energy bound states_ for a system of _three quarks_
	- _Proton_: $\ce{ uud }$
	- _Neutron_: $\ce{ udd }$

- There are two other _generations_:

| 1st generation              | 2nd generation            | 3rd generation            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Electron $\ce{ e- }$        | Muon $\ce{ \mu- }$        | Tau $\ce{ \tau- }$        |
| Electron neutrino $\nu_{e}$ | Muon neutrino $\nu_{\mu}$ | Tau neutrino $\nu_{\tau}$ |
| Up quark $\ce{ u }$         | Charm quark $\ce{ c }$    | Top quark $\ce{ t }$      |
| Down quark $\ce{ d }$       | Strange quark $\ce{ s }$  | Bottom quark $\ce{ s }$                          |

- Each generation is a _replica_ of the last, but with _increasing mass_
- They are _distinct particles_
	- i.e. Not excited states

## Leptons
- _Leptons_ are fermions that _do not interact via the strong interaction_
- _All_ experience the _weak force_

- Each _charged lepton_ $\ce{ e-,\mu-,\tau- }$ have a corresponding _neutrino_ (which are _neutral_)
- The _electron_ is quite stable, while the _muon_ and _tauon_ are _unstable_

- _Neutrinos_ will _only experience the weak force_
- They are _stable_ and _almost massless_

## Quarks
- Quarks experience _all forces_ (strong, EM, weak)
- Each generation has quarks with charges of $+2/3$ and $-1/3$ _respectively_:
$$\begin{pmatrix}u \\ d\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}c\\s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}t\\b\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}+2/3 \\ -1/3\end{pmatrix}$$
- They are either _up-type_ or _down-type_
- There are also _anti-quarks_ of opposite charge
- The _top quark_ is the _heaviest_ ($173\,\text{GeV}/c^{2}$, same as _gold nucleus_) 

- They also come with _colour charge_ (Red, green, blue)
- They label charge for the _strong interaction_
- The three colours are _orthogonal_

- They are always _confined_ within _hadrons_
- _Mesons_ are bound states of a _quark_ and _antiquark_
	- $\pi^{+}$: $(u\bar{d})$
	- $\pi^{-}$: $(\bar{u}d)$, _antiparticle_ of $\pi^{+}$
	- $\pi^{0}$: $(u\bar{u}+d\bar{d})/\sqrt{ 2 }$, its _own antiparticle_
- _Baryons_ are bound states of _three quarks_
	- _Proton_ $p$: $(udu)$
	- _Neutron_ $d$: $(dud)$

## Nuclei
- A _nucleus_ is a bound state of $Z$ protons and $N$ neutrons
- The _mass number_ $A=Z+N$
- A _nuclide_ $^{A}_{Z}X$ is a nucleus specified by $Z$ and $N$
- Isotones, isobars, isotopes:
![[tonesbartopes.png|300]]

- _Elements_ are classified according to $Z$
	- The _chemical properties_ are given by electron number (neutral: $=Z$)
	- Only $\ce{ H,He,Li }$ are from the _Big Bang_
	- Elements up to $\ce{ Fe }$ are from _stars_
	- Elements up to $\ce{ U }$ are from _supernovae_
- Nuclides:
![[Nuclides.png]]
- Higher $Z$ tend to need _more neutrons_ to be stable
- Very _neutron rich_ unstable nuclides decay be $\beta$ decay

# Forces: Bosons
- In _classical mechanics_, forces arise via _action at a distance_
- In _quantum mechanics_, fields are _quantised_
	- Example: [[Quantum electrodynamics|quantisation of the electromagnetic field]]
- Forces arise through the _exchange of virtual field quanta_ (gauge bosons)
- This typically _violates_ energy and momentum conservation
	- Meaning of _virtual_
- In a _short time_, it is permissible by the _uncertainty principle_:
$$\Delta E\Delta t\sim \hbar\implies c\Delta t\sim \hbar \frac{c}{\Delta E}$$
- Hence, a _larger energy transfer_ has a _smaller range_
![[Bosons.png]]
- The _gluon_ is responsible for the _strong nuclear force_
	- There are _8_ gluons due to the $SU(3)$ symmetry
- The _photon_ is responsible for the _electromagnetic force_
- The _W and Z bosons_ are responsible for the _weak force_
	- Strength: $10^{}$
- The _graviton_ is responsible for _gravity_
	- It is by far the _weakest_ force, with a strength of $10^{-39}$ of the strong force

- Gauge bosons are _spin 1 particles_ (exceot the graviton)
- The _W and Z bosons_ are the _only bosons with mass_
- The standard model _does not include gravity_

- The _maximum range_ of a force is _inversely related_ to the _mass_ of the exchanged bosons:
$$c\Delta t\sim \hbar \frac{c}{\Delta E}\sim \frac{\hbar}{mc}$$
![[fundamental force ranges.png|400]]
- At _large distances_, only _bound states themselves_ interact, and they exchange _pions_ instead of _gluons_

## Symmetries and conservation
- [[Analytical classical mechanics#Symmetries and Noether's Theorem|Noether's Theorem]]: Every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law

- _Time translation_ symmetry leads to _energy conservation_
- _Spatial translation/rotation_ symmetry leads to _linear/angular momentum conservation_

- _Lorentz invariance_ leads to $(CPT)$, or _charge parity time_ symmetry
- _Gauge invariance_ leads to _charge conservation_
	- Charges: electric, colour, weak charges

# Particle kinematics
- In _nuclear reactions_, they are typically of _low kinetic energy_ $\sim 10\text{ MeV}\ll m_\text{nucleon}$
	- Exception: _beta decay_
- In _particle physics_, reactions are _relativistic_, $\sim 100\,\text{GeV}\gg m_\text{particle}$

- Most particles and nuclei are _unstable_, and _decays_ give its properties
- Not all decays are _allowed_ due to conservation laws

- Particle _scattering_ involves the _production_ of new massive particles
## Relativistic kinematics
- The _Minkowski metric_:
$$ds^{2}=dt^{2}-|d\boldsymbol{x}|^{2}\hspace{1.5cm}g_{\mu \nu}=\text{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$$

- Relativistic _energy and momenta_:
$$E=\gamma m\hspace{1.6cm}|\boldsymbol{p}|=\gamma m\boldsymbol{\beta}\hspace{1.5cm}\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 1-\beta^{2} }}$$
- Energy-momentum relation:
$$E^{2}=p^{2}+m^{2}$$
- When a particle is at rest, $E=m$
- When a particle is massless, $m=0$, $E=|\boldsymbol{p}|$
- When a particle is _ultra-relativistic_, $E\gg m$, $E\sim|\boldsymbol{p}|$

- The _kinetic energy_:
$$T=E-m=(\gamma-1)m$$

- Kinematics expressed as a _four-vector_:
$$x^{\mu}=(t,\boldsymbol{x})\hspace{1cm}x_{\mu}=(t,-\boldsymbol{x})$$
- The _spacetime interval_ is invariant:
$$\Delta s^{2}=t^{2}-|\boldsymbol{x}|^{2}=g_{\mu \nu}x^{\mu}x^{\nu}$$
- 4-momentum:
$$p^{\mu}=(E,\boldsymbol{p})$$
- The _rest mass is invariant_:
$$m^{2}=E^{2}-|\boldsymbol{p}|^{2}=g_{\mu \nu}p^{\mu}p^{\nu}$$
- For a _system of particles_, the invariant quantity is:
$$M_{X}^{2}=\left( \sum_{i}E_{i} \right)^{2}-\left( \sum_{i} \boldsymbol{p}_{i}\right)^{2}$$
- $M_X$ is _not necessarily the sum of rest masses_

## Particle decays
- Most particles have _finite lifetimes_
- The _number of particles_ must decay:
$$N(t)=N_{0}\exp(-\lambda t)$$
- The _rate of decay_:
$$\frac{dN}{dt}=-\lambda N$$
- The _activity_ $A=|dN/dt|=\lambda N$ for a _single particle_

- The _half-life_:
$$\exp(-\lambda \tau_{1/2})=\frac{1}{2}\implies \tau_{1/2}=0.693\tau$$

- One often finds _decay chains_
$$N_{1}\xrightarrow{\lambda_{1}}N_{2}\xrightarrow{\lambda_{2}}N_{3}$$
- Example: $\ce{ ^{235}U->^{231}Th->^{231}{Pa} }$
- The _activity_ of the daughter:
$$A_{2}=\lambda_{2}N_{2}$$
- The _rate of decay_:
$$\frac{dN_{2}}{dt}=-\lambda_{2}N_{2}+\lambda_{1}N_{1}$$

### Decay rates and lifetimes
- A decay is a _transition_ from one quantum state into another
- It is given by [[Time-dependent quantum mechanics#Fermi's Golden Rule|Fermi's Golden Rule]]:
$$\Gamma(i\to f)=\lambda=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2}\rho(E_{f})$$
- $M_{fi}$ is the _transition matrix element_
- $\lambda \,dt$ is the _probability_ a particle will decay in time $dt$
	- $\lambda$ is the _transition rate_
- $\rho(E_{f})$ is the _final density of state_

- The probability that the particle _decays_ at time interval $t$ to $t+dt$ is $p(t)\lambda dt$, hence the probability that it _survives_ is $p(t+dt)=p(t)(1-\lambda dt)$
- From this, one gets:
$$p(t)=\exp(-\lambda t)$$

- The _average lifetime_ of a particle is then:
$$\tau=\langle t \rangle =\int t\,\left(p(t) \lambda\,dt\right)=\frac{1}{\lambda} $$

### Distribution of energies
- A _finite lifetime_ gives an _uncertain energy_ $\Delta E$
- Decaying states correspond to a _range of energies_:
$$\tau\,\Delta E\sim \hbar=1$$
- Consider a state _formed_ at $t=0$ with _energy_ $E_{0}$ and _mean lifetime_ $\tau$:
$$|\psi(t)|^{2}=|\psi(0)|^{2}\exp\left( -\frac{t}{\tau} \right)\implies \psi(t)=\psi(0)\exp\left( -iE_{0}t \right)\exp\left( -\frac{t}{2\tau} \right)$$
- The _frequencies_ in the wavefunction is given by the _Fourier transform_ of $\psi(t)$:
$$f(\omega)=f(E)=\frac{i\psi(0)}{(E_{0}-E)-i/(2\tau)}$$
- The _probability_ of finding a state in energy $E$ is then:
$$p(E)=|f(E)|^{2}=\frac{|\psi(0)|^{2}}{(E_{0}-E)^{2}-1/4\tau^{2}}$$

- This is a _Lorentzian shape_
	- The _Breit-Wigner peak_
- The _full-width at half maximum_ is simply $\Gamma=\lambda$:
$$P(E=E_{0})=4\tau^{2}\hspace{1.5cm}P\left( E=E_{0}\pm\frac{\Gamma}{2} \right)=\frac{1}{2}(4\tau^{2})$$
![[Breit-Wigner peak.png|300]]

- Particles often decay with _more than one decay mode_
	- Only one decay mode: $\ce{ \mu- ->e- + \bar{\nu}_{e}+\nu_{\mu} }$
$$\ce{ Z-> e+e- or \mu+\mu-}$$

- They all have _partial decay rates_:
$$\lambda_{f}=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2}\rho(E_{f})\hspace{1.5cm}\lambda=\sum_{f}\lambda_{f}$$

- This determines an _average lifetime_:
$$\tau=\frac{1}{\lambda}$$
- The _total width_ of a particle state:
$$\Gamma=\lambda=\sum_{f}\lambda_{f}=\sum_{f}\Gamma_{f}$$
- The _proportion of decays_ to a particular mode is the _branching fraction_:
$$B_{f}=\frac{\Gamma_{f}}{\Gamma}\hspace{1.5cm}\sum_{f} B_{f}=1$$

## Reactions and cross-sections
- An interaction between two particles is a case of _scattering_

- _Elastic scattering_ has the _same particles_ in the initial state and final state
	- Only their _momenta_ change
$$\ce{ a + b -> a + b }$$
- _Inelastic scattering_ has _different particles_ in the initial state and final state:
$$\ce{ a +b -> c +d }$$

### Reaction cross-section
- The _strength_ of the reaction is specified by the _cross-section_
- It is the _effective area_ presented to the _incoming particle_
- Unit: _barn_
$$1\sigma=10^{-28}\,\text{m}^{2}$$

- It is the _reaction rate per target particle_ $\Gamma$, _per unit incident flux_ $\Phi$
	- Flux: number of incoming particles _per unit area per second_
$$\Gamma=\Phi\sigma$$

### Beam attenuation
- Consider a _beam_ of area $A$ with $N$ particles, on a _target_ of $n$ nuclei per unit volume, with _thickness_ $dx$
![[Scattering beam to target.png|300]]
- The _number of target nuclei_ is $N_{T}=nA\,dx$
- The _effective area_ for absorption is $\sigma N_{T}$
- The _incident flux_ is $N/A$
- Therefore, the _number of particles scattered per unit time_ is:
	- This can be used to _find_ $\sigma$
$$-dN=\frac{N}{A} \sigma nA\,dx\implies \sigma=-\frac{dN}{nN\,dx}$$
- One can _integrate_ to find the _beam attenuation_ in a target of thickness $L$:
$$N=N_{0}\exp(-\sigma nL)$$
- The beam attenuates _exponentially_

- For a _thin target_, $N_{0}\sigma nL$ particles are _scattered_
- The _mean free path_ between interactions is $1/n\sigma$
	- Often referred to as the _interaction length_

### Differential cross-section
- The _angular distribution_ of the scattered particles is _not necessarily uniform_
	- Can be considered in _position_ or _momentum space_
- The _number of particles_ scattered in some _solid angle_ $d\Omega$ is:
$$dN_{d\Omega}=d\sigma\, \Phi N_{T}$$
- The _differential cross-section_ is then:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{dN_{d\Omega}}{\Phi N_{T}\times d\Omega}$$
- This is the _number of particles scattered per unit time per unit angle_, divided by the _incident flux times the number of target particles_

- This is _more feasible_ to measure as one does not have to _cover_ the $4\pi$ solid angle

- It provides _more information_ about the reaction

- For a set of particles, there can be _different final states_
	- Example: $\ce{ e+e- -> \gamma }\text{ or }\ce{ Z }$
- One can define _partial cross-sections_ for final state $i$:
$$\sigma=\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}$$
## Relativistic Born Approximation
- Consider a _beam of relativistic particles_ scattering from a _fixed potential_ $V(\boldsymbol{r})$:
	- Different from the [[Quantum scattering theory|purely quantum case]]
![[Particle scattering geometry.png|300]]
- There is a _momentum transfer_
	- Natural units: $\boldsymbol{p}=\boldsymbol{k}$
$$\boldsymbol{q}=\boldsymbol{p}_{f}-\boldsymbol{p}_{i}$$
- The _scattering rate_ is characterised by the _interaction cross-section_:
	- The cross-section is _number of scattered particles per unit time_, divided by the _incident flux_
$$\sigma=\frac{\Gamma}{\Phi}$$
- The transition rate is given by [[Time-dependent quantum mechanics#Fermi's Golden Rule|Fermi's Golden Rule]]:
$$\Gamma=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2}\rho(E_{f})$$
- _Approximate_ the _unperturbed_ wave function as a _normalised plane wave_:
$$\psi_{\boldsymbol{k}}=\frac{1}{L^{3/2}}\exp[i(\boldsymbol{p}\cdot \boldsymbol{r}-Et)]$$
- This gives the _matrix element_:
$$M_{fi}=\braket{ \psi_{f}|V|\psi_{i}  }= \frac{1}{L^{3}}\int \exp(-i\boldsymbol{q}\cdot \boldsymbol{r}) V(\boldsymbol{r})\, d^{3}\boldsymbol{r}  $$
- The _incident flux_ for a beam with _number density_ $n$ and _velocity_ $v_{i}$:
$$\Phi=nv_{i}=\frac{v_{i}}{L^{3}}$$
- As for the _density of states_, consider the _particle in a box_ (neglecting spin):
$$dN=\frac{1}{(2\pi/L)^{3}}d^{3}\boldsymbol{p}=\left( \frac{L}{2\pi} \right)^{3}p^{2}\,dp\,d\Omega$$
- For a _relativistic particle_, $E^{2}=p^{2}+m^{2}$
- This gives the _density of states in energy_:
$$\rho(E)=\frac{dN}{dE}=\left( \frac{L}{2\pi} \right)^{3}pE\,d\Omega$$
- The approximation is for an _ultra-relativistic particle_

- This gives the _differential cross-section_:
	- _Different_ from the [[Quantum scattering theory#The Born Approximation|quantum case]]
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{2}v_{i}}\left| \int \exp(-i\boldsymbol{q}\cdot \boldsymbol{r})V(\boldsymbol{r}) \, d^{3}\boldsymbol{r}  \right|^{2}p_{f}E_{f} $$
- For _relativistic scattering_, $v_{i}\approx 1$ and $E\approx p$:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{E^{2}}{(2\pi)^{2}} \left| \int \exp(-i\boldsymbol{q}\cdot \boldsymbol{r})V(\boldsymbol{r}) \, d^{3}\boldsymbol{r}  \right|^{2}$$
### Relativistic Rutherford scattering
- Consider _relativistic Coulomb scattering_
	- A special case of the _Yukawa potential_ $V(r)=g\exp(-mr)/r$ with $g=Z\alpha$ and $m=0$
$$V(\boldsymbol{r})=-\frac{Ze^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r}=-\frac{Z\alpha}{r}$$
- For _scattering angle_ $\theta$, one can derive:
$$q^{2}=4E^{2}\sin^{2}\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)$$
- This gives the _differential cross-section_:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{Z^{2}\alpha^{2}}{4E^{2}\sin^{4}(\theta/2)}$$
## Resonant scattering
- Particle interactions can take place via a _resonant state_, which then _decays_:
$$\ce{ a +b->Z^{*}->c +d }$$
- This is a _two stage picture_:
	- _Formation_ occurs when the _collision energy_ $E_\text{CM}$ is _approximately_ equal to the _natural frequency_ (mass) of $\ce{ Z^{*} }$ 
	- _Decay_ is _independent_ of the mode of formation and depends _only_ on tha nature of $\ce{ Z^{*} }$, and there can be _multiple decay modes_

- The _resonance cross-section_:
$$d\sigma=\frac{1}{\Phi}2\pi |M_{fi}|^{2}\rho(E_{f})$$
- The _density of states_ is _fixed_ by only _one particle_, as _energy conservation_ fixes the energy of the other:
$$\rho(E_{f})=\left( \frac{L}{2\pi} \right)^{3}p^{2} \frac{E}{p}\,d\Omega=\left( \frac{L}{2\pi} \right)^{3} \frac{p_{f}^{2}}{v_{f}}\,d\Omega$$
- This gives the differential cross-section:
	- Redefine the matrix element in order to _cancel_ the $L^{3}$ factor
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{p_{f}^{2}}{(2\pi)^{2}v_{i}v_{f}}\left| M_{fi} \right|^{2} $$
- The matrix element is given by _second order perturbation theory_:
	- The [[Time-dependent quantum mechanics#A general Hamiltonian|second order coefficient]]
	- The effects are _large_ as $E-E_{Z}$ is _small_
$$M_{fi}=\sum_{Z}\frac{M_{iZ}M_{Zf}}{E-E_{Z}}$$
- The sum _runs over all intermediate states_
	- Near _resonance_, only one state contributes _significantly_

- Consider the _intermediate state_:
$$\psi_{Z}(t)=\psi_{Z}(0)\exp(-iE_{0}t)\exp\left( -\frac{t}{2\tau} \right)=\psi_{Z}(0)\exp\left[ i\left( E_{0}-i\frac{\Gamma}{2} \right)t \right]$$
- Therefore, the state has _energy_ $E_{0}-i\Gamma/2$, and the matrix element is:
$$\left| M_{fi} \right|^{2}=\frac{|M_{iZ}|^{2}|M_{Zf}|^{2}}{(E-E_{0})^{2}+\Gamma^{2}/4} $$
- The rates of _decay_ and _formation_:
	- $\Gamma_{i\to Z}=\Gamma_{Z\to i}$
$$\begin{align}\Gamma_{i\to Z}&=2\pi \left| M_{iZ} \right|^{2}\rho(E_{i})=|M_{iZ}|^{2} \frac{p_{i}^{2}}{\pi v_{i}} \\ \Gamma_{Z\to f}&= 2\pi|M_{Zf}|^{2} \rho(E_{f})=|M_{Zf}|^{2} \frac{p_{f}^{2}}{\pi v_{f}}\end{align}$$
- This gives the _Breit-Wigner (resonance) cross-section_:
$$\sigma=\frac{\pi g}{p_{i}^{2}} \frac{\Gamma_{i\to Z}\Gamma_{Z\to f}}{(E-E_{0})^{2}+\Gamma^{2}/4}$$
- The factor $g$ accounts for _spin_:
$$\ce{ a +b->Z^{*}->c +d }\hspace{1.25cm}g=\frac{2J_{Z}+1}{(2J_{a}+1)(2J_{b}+1)}$$
- This the _ratio_ of the number of _$Z^{*}$ spin states_ to the _total number of $\ce{ a+b }$ spin states_
	- Probability that $\ce{ a+b }$ collide in the _correct spin state_ to form $Z^{*}$

- $\sigma$ is a _frame-independent quantity_
	- $p_{i}$ must be calculated in the _centre of mass frame_
	- If the target is _heavy_, $p_{i}$ is approximately the _lab momentum_
- $E$ is the _total energy_, and $\Gamma$ is the _total decay rate_
	- $\Gamma_{i\to Z}$ and $\Gamma_{Z\to f}$ are the _partial decay rates_

- The _total cross-section_:
$$\sigma _\text{tot}=\sum_{f} \sigma(i\to f)$$
- The _total decay rate_ $\Gamma$ must be used for the denominator in the Breit-Wigner formula

- The _elastic cross-section_:
	- In this case, $\Gamma_{i}=\Gamma_{f}$
$$\sigma _\text{el}=\sigma(i\to i)$$
- At the _peak of resonance_:
$$\displaylines{\sigma _\text{peak}=\frac{4\pi g\Gamma_{i}\Gamma_{f}}{p_{i}^{2}\Gamma^{2}} \\ \sigma _\text{el}=\frac{4\pi gB_{i}^{2}}{p_{i}^{2}} \hspace{1cm}\sigma _\text{tot}=\frac{4\pi gB_{i}}{p_{i}^{2}}\hspace{1cm}B_{i}=\frac{\Gamma_{i}}{\Gamma}=\frac{\sigma _\text{el}}{\sigma _\text{tot}}}$$
- Hence, one can _cancel_ $B_{i}$ and _infer_ $g$, and the _spin_ of the _resonant state_

- One can _produce the same resonance_ from _different initial states_:
![[Resonances.png|500]]

# Colliders
- Consider the _collision_ of two particles
- The _invariant quantity_:
$$\begin{align}
s=E_\text{CM}=(p_{1}+p_{2})^{2}=(E_{1}+E_{2})^{2}-(\boldsymbol{p}_{1}+) \\
\end{align}$$
- $\sqrt{ s }$ gives the _highest amount of energy available for particle collision_

## Causing a collision
- A _fixed target collision_ has a particle hitting another _stationary_ particle
- For the _ultrarelativistic regime_ $E_{1}\gg m_{1},m_2$, this gives $\sqrt{ s }\sim \sqrt{  }$
- A typical experiment gives a mass energy of $30\text{ GeV}$
	- A lot of energy contributes to _momentum for the final state_

- A _collider experiment_ has _moving particles collide head-on_
- In the ultra-relativistic regime, $\sqrt{ s }\sim$
- A typical experiment gives a mass energy of $900\text{ GeV}$
- The final state can be relatively _stationary_

- For high $E_\text{CM}$, one needs to _accelerate_ particles to high energy
- One can use a _voltage_, but the geometry is _linear_ and wastes space
- Instead, one can use _circular colliders_, with _magnetic fields_
	- It is limited by [[Electrodynamics and Optics#Synchotron radiation|synchotron radiation emission]]

## Particle detection
- After the collision event, a _detector_ needs to be used to deduce the final state

- _Trackers_ detect _ionisation_ using gas
	- Only works for _charged particles_
	- Example: cloud chambers
- For a tracker _in a magnetic field_, the particles _bend_
	- The _radius of curvature_ gives its _momentum_
	- Accuracy of detection $$\frac{\sigma_{p}}{p}\propto p$$
	- High momentum: high $R$, almost _straight_
	- _Lower momentum_ particles are _easier to measure accurately_

- _Calorimeters_ detect the _energy_ of the particle using _high-density absorbers_ and _scintillating material_ to collect energy
	- The high density material initiates a _particle shower_
	- It detects both _neutral and charged particles_
- The length scale of _nuclear interactions_ is _longer_ than that of _radiation_
- For _hadrons_, one needs _denser materials_ for the calorimeters
	- Particles go through the _electromagnetic_ calorimeter before the _hadronic_ calorimeter
- _Higher energy_ particles produce showers with _many particles_, giving _low uncertainty_
	- $\sigma_{E}/E \propto \sqrt{ N }/E=1/\sqrt{ E }$

- _Muons_ can typically move _through_ both detectors and calorimeters
- _Neutrinos_ require _specialised detectors_
![[Detector design.png]]

- Types of signals:
	- Hadrons: _charged_ ones leave tracks, all have heavy deposits in HCAL
	- Muons leave _tracks_, with small CAL deposits, but still _penetrate_
	- _Quarks_ manifest as _jets_ of hadrons due to _gluons_
	- _Taus_ typically _decay_ within the beam

# The standard model
- Particles include [[#Matter Fermions|fermions]] in _matter_, the [[#Forces Bosons|spin-1 bosons]] providing _forces_, and the _Higgs boson_, with _spin-0_ and generating _mass_

- The standard model is a collection of _gauge theories_ for _quantum fields_
	- They must satisfy _local gauge invariance_

 - _Quantum electrodynamics_ (QED) _quantises_ the electromagnetic fields
 - _Electroweak unification_ combined _electromagnetism_ and the _weak force_
 - _Quantum chromodynamics_ quantised the _strong force_

- The time-independent _Schrodinger equation_ for a _free particle_:
$$i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=-\frac{1}{2m}\nabla^{2}\psi$$
- It is _not Lorentz invariant_

- From special relativity:
$$E^{2}=p^{2}+m^{2}$$
- Substituting operators:
$$-\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial t^{2}}=-\nabla^{2}\psi+m^{2}\psi$$
- One can get _plane wave solutions_:
$$\psi=$$
- The _complete set_ of eigenstates gives _negative energy solutions_
	- Gives rise to concept of _antimatter_

- A _linear_ relativistic wave equation is the _Dirac equation_:
$$i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=(-i\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot \nabla+\beta m)\psi$$
- $\psi$ is a _spinor_ with four components
- Two of the components still have _negative energy_

## Antiparticles
- A plane wave solution dictates time dependence $\exp(-iEt)$, which would indicate _negative energy states_ propagating _backwards in time_
- However, making the simultaneous transformation $E\to -E$ and $t\to -t$:
$$\exp[-iEt]\equiv\exp[-i(-E)(-t)]$$
- Hence, a _negative energy particle_ corresponds to a _positive energy antiparticle_ travelling _forwards in time_

- Example: consider $\ce{ e- +\gamma -> e- +\gamma }$
![[Electron photon interactions.png]]
- The former has a _positive energy electron_ emitted as the photon has _less energy_ than the original electron
- The latter has the emission of a photon with _more energy_, and can be seen as:
	- _Emission_ of a _negative_ energy $\ce{ e- }$ travelling _backwards in time_
	- Or the _absorption_ of a _positive_ energy $\ce{ e+ }$ travelling _forwards in time_

## Interaction via particle exchange and the Yukawa potential
- Consider two particles _fixed_ at $\boldsymbol{r}_{1}$ and $\boldsymbol{r}_{2}$ which _exchange_ a particle of mass $m$
	- A _generic_ particle
![[Interaction particle exchange.png]]

- Yukawa theory postulates that it is due to _exchange of massive quanta_
- The _rate of momentum exchange_ then provides a _force_

- As the quantum carries _energy_, its existence is _transient_, with time duration given by:
$$\Delta E\Delta t\sim \hbar$$
- It is said to be _virtual_
### Using perturbation theory
- The _shift_ in energy of $i$ due to the exchange using _second order perturbation theory_:
$$\Delta E_{i}=\sum_{j\neq i} \braket{  |  } $$
- The sum is _over all possible momenta_

- Consider the transition $i\to j$ by emission of $m$ at $\boldsymbol{r}_{1}$:
$$\psi_{i}=\psi_{1}\psi_{2} \hspace{1.5cm}\psi_{j}=\psi_{1}\psi_{2}\psi_{3}$$
- Here, $\psi_{3}$ represents a _free particle_ with 4-momentum

- Let $g$ be the _probability_ of emitting $m$ at $\boldsymbol{r}_{1}$
$$\braket{  |  }= $$
- The factor $1/\sqrt{ 2E }$ is a _normalisation factor_

- Integrate over all momenta

- Using contour integration:
$$\Delta E_{i}^{1\to 2}=-\frac{g^{2}}{8\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$
- Consider an exchange from $2$ to $1$:
$$\Delta E_{i}^{2\to 1}=-\frac{g^{2}}{8\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$
- Therefore, the _total shift in energy_ due to particle exchange is given by the _Yukawa potential_:
$$\Delta E_{i}=-\frac{g^{2}}{4\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$
- The _characteristic range_ is $1/m$
	- The _Compton wavelength_ of the exchanged particle
- For $m\to 0$, this gives the _Coulomb potential_

### From the Klein-Gordon equation
- Describe the system using the _Klein-Gordon equation_:
$$\frac{\partial^{2}\psi}{\partial t^{2}}=\nabla^{2}\psi-m^{2}\psi$$
- Setting $m=0$, it is the _electromagnetic wave equation_ $(c=1)$
- $\psi$ is interpreted as the _amplitude_ of the associated _photon_, or as a [[Electrodynamics and Optics#Maxwell's equations in terms of potentials|potential]] $V(\boldsymbol{r})$

- To generalise, $m$ is the _mass of the boson_ responsible for the interaction
	- $0$ for photons and gluons
	- Non-zero for _gauge bosons_ $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$

- For a _static, spherically symmetric system_, one can solve _Poisson's equation_:
$$V(r)=-\frac{g^{2}}{4\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$
- Here, $-g^{2}$ is an _integration constant_ to match the formula from perturbation theory

## Scattering from the Yukawa potential
- Consider _elastic scattering_ from the _Yukawa potential_
- The _source_ of the potential has _coupling strength_ $g_{0}$
- The _scattered particle_ has coupling $g$, giving the potential:
$$V(r)=-\frac{g_{0}g}{4\pi} \frac{\exp(-mr)}{r}$$

- The _3-momentum transfer_ is $\boldsymbol{p}$, and for elastic scattering, there is _no energy transfer_
- Define the _4-momentum transfer_ as:
$$q^{\mu}=(\Delta E,\boldsymbol{p})=(0,\boldsymbol{p})$$

- The Born approximation gives:
$$M_{fi}=-\frac{g_{0}g}{4\pi} \int \frac{1}{r}\exp(-mr-i\boldsymbol{p}\cdot \boldsymbol{r}) \, d^{3}\boldsymbol{r} $$

- Evaluating the _contour integral_:
$$M_{fi}=\frac{g^{2}}{q^{2}-m^{2}}$$
- Here, $q$ is the _invariant mass_ of 4-vector $q^{\mu}$
- It is interpreted as two _vertex factors_ $g_{0},g$, with the _propagator term_ $(q^{2}-m^{2})^{-1}$

### Virtual mass
- Forces arise due to the _exchange_ of the _virtual particle_ of mass $q$
	- They are _unobservable_ as the act of observation disrupts the interaction

- $q$ is known as the _virtual (off shell) mass_
	- It can be _positive_, _negative_, or _imaginary_
- It is _not necessarily equal to the physical (on shell) mass_ $m$

- A virtual particle with an _off-mass shell_ of $\Delta m=|q-m|$ can exist for:
$$\Delta t\sim\frac{1}{\Delta m}$$
- If $q^{2}=m^{2}$, the particle is _real and observable_

### The boson propagator
- Given a _set_ of possible interactions, which may consist of _multiple scattering processes_, the _matrix elements add up_:
$$M_{fi}=M_{1}+M_{2}+\dots=\sum_\text{interactions} \left( \prod g_{i} \right)\left( \prod \frac{1}{q^{2}-m^{2}} \right)$$

- The propagators $(q^{2}-m^{2})^{-1}$ are roughly _inversely proportional_ to _how off-shell the virtual mass is_
- The _more off-shell the virtual mass_, the more _difficult_ the probability of _creating the virtual state_, and the _smaller the contribution to the matrix element_
# Feynman diagrams
- Only the _initial and final states_ of a scattering process can be known
- Calculations depend on the _time ordering_ of absorptions and emissions
	- Using _time ordered perturbation theory_, dependent on the _reference frame_

- A _Feynman diagram_ represents the _sum of all time orderings_
- Each Feybman diagramn represents a _term in the perturbation theory expansion_
- A _full matrix element_ contains an _infinite number of Feynman diagrams_:
$$\displaylines{M_{fi}=M_{1}+M_{2}+\dots \\ \Gamma_{fi}=2\pi|M_{fi}|^{2}\rho (E)}$$

- Each _vertex_ in a Feynman diagram contains a factor of $g$ from the [[#Interaction via particle exchange|Yukawa potential]]:
![[Feynman g factors.png]]
- The _approximate size_ of a matrix element is given by the _lowest order diagram_:
$$M_{fi}\sim \frac{\prod g}{q^{2}-m^{2}}$$

- Creation of _virtual particles_ must conserve mass and momentum
	- If it _only_ has the _real mass_, it is _not conserved_

## Pictoral representation of particles
- The _topological features_ of the diagram are associated with _terms in the matrix element_

- Representation of _particles_:
![[Feynman diagram lines.png|400]]

- _External_ lines for _real particles_:
![[Feynman external particles.png|400]]
- _Internal_ lines for _virtual particles_:
![[Feynman internal lines.png|550]]

## Vertices
- Each interaction has _different_ $g$
	- EM interaction: $g=Qe$
	- Weak interaction: $g=g_{W}$
	- Strong interaction: $g=\sqrt{ \alpha_{s} }$

- Each vertex typically has _three lines_
	- Examples: pair production, annihilation, emission

- Conserved quantities:
	- Energy
	- Momentum and angular momentum
	- Charge
	- Lepton number $(L_{e}=+1)$, minus for antiparticles
	- Baryon number $B=(n_{q}-n_{\bar{q}})/3$
	- Strangeness $S=-(n_{s}-n_{\bar{s}})$
	- Parity _except for weak interactions_

- Due to the _relative strengths_ of the fundamental forces, an interaction takes place via the _strong force_ as the _priority_, followed by _electromagnetic_, followed by _weak_
	- The stronger the interaction, the bigger the _contribution_ to the matrix element
### Electromagnetic interactions
- Vertices for _electromagnetic_ interactions must involve a _photon_ and _charged particles_
- Coupling strength $Qe$, where $Q$ is the _charge_
- One can have _triple gauge vertices_ involving _no fermions_ (from electroweak interaction)

### Weak interactions
- Vertices for _weak interactions_ must involve a _gauge vector boson_ $Z$ or $W^{\pm}$
- _Neutrinos_ can _only appear in weak interactions_
- Coupling strength $g_{W}$
- $W^{\pm}$ can _change quark flavour_, and also _cross quark generations_ (not lepton)
	- Same generation: Cabibbo favoured
	- Cross generation: Cabibbo suppressed
	- Cross two generations: Doubly Cabibbo suppressed
- The $Z$ boson _cannot change flavour_, and only _pair produces_
- From _lepton number conservation_, there are _no vertices connecting leptons to quarks_
- One can have _triple/quadruple gauge vertices_ from _self-interaction_
- There are often _spectator quarks_ as interactions happen in _hadrons_

### Strong interactions
- Vertices for _strong interactions_ must involve a _gluon_ $g$ and/or quark $q$
	- Interact with _colour charge_
	- Hence, _no interactions_ with neutrinos, photons, $Z$ and $W^{\pm}$ bosons
- Coupling strength $\sqrt{ \alpha_{s} }$
- Can also _self-interact_ to produce triple/quadruple gauge vertices

![[Example feynman diagrams.png]]

### s,t,u channels
- $s-$channel diagrams: _annihilatiom/pair production_
- $t-$channel diagrams: _exchanging_ virtual particles
	- Special case - $u-$channel: _identical_ particles in the final state, hence the it is _indistinguishable_ which vertex they came form
- Each case has _different propagators_ due to _differing virtual mass_

- If there are _two channels of the same order_, the _matrix elements add_

# Quantum electrodynamics
- QED is the _gauge theory_ of electromagnetic interactions
- A _non-relativistic_ charged particle in an EM field:
$$\boldsymbol{F}=q(\boldsymbol{E}+\boldsymbol{v}\times \boldsymbol{B})$$
- Vector and scalar potentials:
$$\boldsymbol{E}=$$
- The _Hamiltonian_:
$$H=$$
- The Schrodinger equation:
$$\psi$$
- The _local gauge transformation_:
$$\psi\to \exp(iq\alpha)\psi \hspace{1cm}\boldsymbol{A}\to \boldsymbol{A}+\nabla\alpha \hspace{1cm}\varphi\to \varphi-\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial t}$$
- Requires the existence of a _physical gauge field_
- There must also be a _conserved quantity_, given by _electric charge_

## Processes in QED
- The _standard electromagnetic vertex_:

- The _coupling_ is _proportional_ to the _electric charge_
- QED _never_ changes _particle type_ or _flavour_

- Compton scattering:
![[Compton scattering Feyman.png]]
$$M \propto \frac{g^{2}}{q^{2}}\propto e^{2} \propto \alpha \implies \sigma \propto \alpha^{2}$$
- _Bremsstrahlung_ and _pair production_ can only occur with the assistance of a _nucleus_
	- It is _kinematically impossible_ in vacuum
	- $M \propto Ze^{3}$

- _Electron-positron_ annihilation:
	- $M\propto Q_{q}e^{2}$
- _Pion decay_:
	- It _must_ occur via an electron/positron to _conserve angular momentum_
	- $M\propto Q_{u}^{2}e^{2}$
- $J/\psi$ decay:
	- The $J/\psi$ has _spin 1_, therefore decays _directly_
	- $M\propto Q_{c}e^{2}$

## Scattering processes in QED

### Electron-proton scattering
- Consider _electron-proton scattering_ in the $t-$channel
![[e-p scattering Feynman.png]]
- From the formula for [[#Relativistic Born Approximation]]:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{E^{2}}{(2\pi)^{2}}|M|^{2}$$
- The matrix element is given by:
$$M=\frac{e^{2}}{q^{2}}=\frac{4\pi\alpha}{q^{2}}$$
- $q$ represents the _4-momentum of the virtual photon_
- _Neglecting_ electron mass, one gets:
$$q^{2}=-2E_{i}E_{f}(1-\cos\theta)$$
- Hence for _elastic scattering_:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{\alpha^{2}}{4E^{2}\sin^{4}\theta/2}$$

- For _high_ $q$, results imply that the _scattering potential is not point-like_
- The scattering potential _resolves_ the _structure_ of the proton

### Electron-positron annihilation
- Consider _electron-positron annihilation_
![[e-e+ annihilation.png]]
- In the _centre of mass frame_, one gets $q^{2}=(2E)^{2}=s$
- This gives the cross-section:
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{\alpha^{2}}{s}\implies \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\frac{4\pi\alpha^{2}}{s}$$
- Taking the _spin states_ into account (to create a spin-1 photon):
$$\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega }=\frac{\alpha^{2}}{4s}(1+\cos^{2}\theta)$$
## Experimental tests of QED
- Example: _magnetic moments_ of the electron and muon:
$$\boldsymbol{\mu}=\frac{ge}{2m}\boldsymbol{s}$$
- Dirac equation predicts that $g=2$

- However, _higher order terms_ introduce an _anomalous_ magnetic moment
![[Magnetic moment diagrams.png]]
- One must _sum over all possible diagrams for an order_
	- Example: $72$ for $O(\alpha^{3})$, $12672$ for $O(\alpha^{4})$

## Higher order diagrams
- Higher order diagrams for electron-positron-annihilation (non-exhaustive)
![[e+e- annihilation higher orders.png]]
- The _cross-section_ of the matrix elements is _supressed_ by $\alpha^{2}\approx 1/137^{2}$ each time

- Higher order contributions can interfere _constructively or destructively_
	- Electron-proton scattering: $M\sim -e^{2}+e^{4}$
	- Positron-proton scattering: $M\sim e^{2}+e^{4}$

## Variation in interaction strength
- $\alpha=e^{2}/4\pi$ specifies the _strength_ of electromagnetic interactions

- However, it is _not a constant_
- _Quantum fluctuations_ around charges create a _cloud_ of _virtual_ $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs, which are then _polarised_, _screening_ the electric charge
	- Similar to the _screening_ of charges in a _dielectric medium_
![[Virtual particle charge screening.png]]
- At _large distances_, the bare electron charge is _sceened_
- For _shorter distances_, there is a _larger effective charge_ and hence larger $\alpha$

- Example: measurement of $\alpha(q^{2})$ from $\ce{ e+e- -> \mu+\mu- }$
	- $q^{2}\approx 0$: $\alpha\sim 1/137$
	- $q^{2}\approx (100 \text{GeV})^{2}$: $\alpha\sim 1/128$

- This is the _running_ of $\alpha$ with energy
