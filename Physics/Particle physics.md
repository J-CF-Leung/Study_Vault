- The study of _elementary particles_ and their interactions
- Desscibed using the _standard model_

- _Atoms_ are _electrons_ bound to _nuclei_ with an EM force, of binding energy $\sim 10\,\text{eV}$
	- Size $\sim 10^{-10}\,\text{m}$
	- Mass 
- _Nuclei_ are bound together by the _strong nuclear force_, of binding energy $\sim 10\,\text{MeV}$
	- Size $\sim 5\times10^{-15}\,\text{m}$
	- Mass
- _Nucleons_ are _quarks_ bound together by the strong force, of binding energy $\sim 1\,\text{GeV}$
	- Mass of nucleons $m_{p}\approx1800m_{e}$

- All matter is made of _spin_$-1/2$ fundamental particles
- There are two types: _leptons_ and _quarks_
	- Leptons: _electron, muon, tauons_, with corresponding _neutrinos_
	- Quarks: _up_, _down_, _top_, _bottom_, _strange_, _charm_
- They each have three _generations_
- Each particle has a corresponding _antiparticle_
	- Due to the _Dirac equation_
	- Identical _mass, spin, energy_
	- _Opposite sign_ for interactions (e.g. electric charge)

- The _first generation_: Electron, electron neutrino, up quark, down quark

| Particle | Symbol | Type | Charge$/e$ |
| -------- | ------ | ---- | ---------- |
|          |        |      |            |

- The _proton_ and _neutron_ are the _lowest energy bound states_ for a system of _three quarks_

- The _second generation_: muon, ...

- The _third generation_

- Each generation is a _replica_ of the last, but with _increasing mass_
- They are _distinct particles_
	- i.e. Not excited states

- _Leptons_ are fermions that _do not interact via the strong interaction_
- _Neutrinos_ will _only experience the weak force_
- They are _stable_ and _almost massless_

- The _electron_ is quite stable, while the _muon_ and _tauon_ are _unstable_

- Quarks experience _all forces_ (strong, EM, weak)
- Each generation has quarks with charges of $+2/3$ and $-1/3$ _respectively_:
$$\begin{pmatrix}u \\ d\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}c\\s\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}t\\b\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}+2/3 \\ -1/3\end{pmatrix}$$
- They are either _up-type_ or _down-type_
- There are also _anti-quarks_ of opposite charge
- The _top quark_ is the _heaviest_ ($173\,\text{GeV}/c^{2}$, same as _gold nucleus_) 

- They also come with _colour charge_ (Red, green, blue)
- They label charge for the _strong interaction_
- The three colours are _orthogonal_

- They are always _confined_ within _hadrons_
- _Mesons_ are bound states of a _quark_ and _antiquark_
	- $\pi^{+}$: $(u\bar{d})$
	- $\pi^{-}$: $(\bar{u}d)$, _antiparticle_ of $\pi^{+}$
	- $\pi^{0}$: $(u\bar{u}+d\bar{d})/\sqrt{ 2 }$, its _own antiparticle_
- _Baryons_ are bound states of _three quarks_
	- _Proton_ $p$: $(udu)$
	- _Neutron_ $d$: $(dud)$

- A _nucleus_ is a bound state of $Z$ protons and $N$ neutrons
- The _mass number_ $A=Z+N$
- A _nuclide_ $^{A}_{Z}X$ is a nucleus specified by $Z$ and $N$
- Isotones, isobars, isotopes:
![[tonesbartopes.png|300]]

- _Elements_ are classified according to $Z$
	- The _chemical properties_ are given by electron number (neutral: $=Z$)
	- Only $\ce{ H,He,Li }$ are from the _Big Bang_
	- Elements up to $\ce{ Fe }$ are from _stars_
	- Elements up to $\ce{ U }$ are from _supernovae_
- Nuclides:
![[Nuclides.png]]
- Higher $Z$ tend to need _more neutrons_ to be stable
- Very _neutron rich_ unstable nuclides decay be $\beta$ decay

- In _classical mechanics_, forces arise via _action at a distance_:
- In _quantum mechanics_, fields are _quantised_
	- Second quantisation
- Forces arise through the _exchange of virtual field quanta_ (gauge bosons)
- This typically _violates_ energy and momentum conservation
	- Meaning of _virtual_
- In a _short time_, it is permissible by the _uncertainty principle_:
$$\Delta E\Delta t\sim \hbar\implies c\Delta t\sim \hbar \frac{c}{\Delta E}$$
- Hence, a _larger energy transfer_ has a _smaller range_

- The _gluon_ is responsible for the _strong nuclear force_
	- There are _8_ gluons due to the $SU(3)$ symmetry
- The _photon_ is responsible for the _electromagnetic force_
- The _W and Z bosons_ are responsible for the _weak force_
	- Strength: $10^{}$
- The _graviton_ is responsible for _gravity_
	- It is by far the _weakest_ force, with a strength of $10^{-39}$ of the strong force


- Gauge bosons are _spin 1 particles_ (exceot the graviton)
- The _W and Z bosons_ are the _only bosons with mass_
- The standard model _does not include gravity_

- The _maximum range_ of a force is _inversely related_ to the _mass_ of the exchanged bosons:
$$c\Delta t\sim \hbar \frac{c}{\Delta E}\sim \frac{\hbar}{mc}$$

- At _large distances_, only _bound states themselves_ interact, and they exchange _pions_ instead of _gluons_
