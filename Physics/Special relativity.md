# Foundational concepts

## Inertial reference frames
- All measurements are made in _inertial reference frames_
- It can be imagined as a 3D _lattice_ with clocks at every point
- The _spacing_ between points is _uniform_, and the _clocks tick uni
# The fundamental principles of Einsteinian relativity

1. The laws of physics are _identical for all inertial frames of reference_
	- The _forms_ of the laws are _invariant with respect to coordinate transformations_
2. The velocity at which interactions _propagate_ (aka. the maximum possible velocity in the universe), the speed of light $c$, is the same in all inertial frames of reference
$$c=2.99792458\times10^8\,\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-1}$$

- In Galilean relativity, distances are relative, and time is absolute
- In Einsteinian relativity (or just relativity), neither distance and time are absolute
	- From the fact that _no velocities exceed_ $c$
	- This implies that _simultaneity_ of events is not conserved across inertial frames
	- Galilean relativity can be obtained by letting $c\rightarrow\infty$

# Intervals
- A particular set of _spatial and temporal coordinates_ is termed an _event_
- Space-time can be described by points in a _4-dimensional space_, known as _world-points_, which form a _world-line_
	- A _uniform motion_ produces a _straight_ world-line

- Let there be _two reference frames_ $K$ and $K'$
	- The axes $X$ and $X'$ coincide
	- $Y$ and $Z$ are parallel to $Y'$ and $Z'$
	- The times are $t$ and $t'$

- For _any two events_ $1$ and $2$, the _interval_ $s$ in $K$ is defined as:
$$s_{12}^2=c^2(t_2-t_1)^2-(x_2-x_1)^2-(y_2-y_1)^2-(x_2-x_1)^2$$
- If the two events are _infinitely close_:
$$ds^2=c^2dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2$$
- It can be proven that the interval is _invariant between frames_
	- If $ds=0$, $ds'=0$, and as they are of the same order, $ds^2$ between two frames must be _proportional_ to each other
	- Due to the _homogeneity and isotropy of space and time_, the proportionality constant must only depend on the _magnitude of relative velocity_ between the two frames
	- By comparing the _ratios of proportionality constants_ for 3 frames, one concludes that the constant must be _unity_
