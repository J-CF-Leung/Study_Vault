- Continental drift theory: correspondence between coasts of Africa and South America
	- Other evidence - _rock types_, _fossils_, and _geological structures_ on the coasts

- _Tectonic plates_ on the _lithosphere_ move:
![[Tectonic plates.png]]

- Types of boundaries:
	- _Lithosphere_: elastic solid (crust + upper solid mantle)
	- _Athenosphere_: liquid part of mantle
![[Plate boundaries.png]]

- Other evidence: _stripes_ of _reversed magnetic polarity_, or _velocity profile_

- In _3 dimensions_, the most _general motion_ with a _fixed point_ can be regarded as a _rotation_, with the _axis through the fixed point_ (centre of Earth)

- _Divergent boundary_:
	- Example: _Mid-Atlantic ridge_ (mostly underwater, and through Iceland)
![[Divergent boundary.png|400]]

- _Conservative boundary_:
	- Example: _San Andreas Fault_
![[Conservative boundary.png|400]]

- _Destructive boundary_:
	- $A$: _overriding_ plate, $C$: _subducting_ plate
	- Example: Ring of Fire _trenches/subduction zones_
