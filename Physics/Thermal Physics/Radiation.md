- Consider any body with some _finite temperature_ $T$
- The _motion of atoms_ give rise to an _acceleration of charged particles_
- They must then cause the _emission of electromagnetic radiation_

- This is known as _Blackbody Radiation_

- This is a _gas of photons_, where _surfaces_ will continually _emit, absorb and reflect_ photons
	- The _number of photons_ is _not fixed_
- Classically, it can be seen as a _superposition_ of many standing EM waves

- All photons have the _same speed_, but with _different energy and momenta_

## Energy and radiation pressure
- Introduce the _spectral energy density_ $u_\lambda$, where the _energy per unit volume_ in wavelength range $\lambda$ to $\lambda+d\lambda$ is $u_\lambda\,d\lambda$
- It is a function of $\lambda$ and $T$
	- It is an _intrinsic property_ of the radiation

- The _energy density_ $u$ is then:
$$u(T)=\int u_\lambda(\lambda, T)\,d\lambda$$
- Suppose the _number of photons per unit volume_ in the energy range $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon+d\epsilon$ is $n(\epsilon)\,d\epsilon$
- Consider the number of photons hitting a _unit area per unit time_, with energy in range $[\epsilon,\epsilon+d\epsilon]$ in _angle range_ $[\theta,\theta+d\theta]$:
$$dN=[n(\epsilon)d\epsilon](c\cos\theta)\frac{2\pi\sin\theta\,d\theta}{4\pi}$$
- Using [[Relativity|Einstein's energy-momentum relation]], and the fact that _photons are massless_:
$$\epsilon=|\bm{p}|c$$
- For _perfectly reflecting surfaces_, $\Delta p$ on the surface is $2\epsilon\cos\theta/c$
- Hence, the _pressure_ is:
$$P=\int_{0}^\infty \int_0^{\pi}=\frac{1}{3}u$$

## Kirchoff's Law
- For a photon gas of _number density_ $n$, the _flux of photons_ is:
$$\text{Flux}=$$

## Stefan-Boltzmann Law
- The _internal energy_ is:
$$U=u(T)V$$
