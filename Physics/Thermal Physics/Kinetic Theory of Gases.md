- Consider a _dilute monoatomic gas_
	- The _average distance_ between the particles is _much bigger_ than their size
	- There are only _translational_ degrees of freedom
- The gas particles _do not interact_ with each other

- Particles can only _exchange energy_ via _collisions_
- The system remains in _equilibrium_

- Every particle behaves as if it's in equilibrium with a _reservoir_ of temperature $T$
- The reservoir is simply _every other gas particle_
- Hence, one can use results from the [[Statistical thermodynamics#Statistics, density of states, and ensembles|canonical ensemble]], where the _energies_ of each particle obey the [[Statistical thermodynamics#Boltzmann Distribution|Boltzmann Distribution]]


## 1 dimensional case
- Each _component_ of velocity behaves _independently_
- Hence, one can _derive the 3D distribution from the 1D distribution_
- It is useful for finding the pressure on a _flat wall_

- Define the _1D velocity distribution function_ $f_{1D}(v_x)$ such that $f_{1D}\,dv_x$ is the _fraction of gas particles_ travelling in velocity range $[v_x,v_x+dv_x]$
- As the states are _equally spaced_ in velocity:
$$f_{1D}(v_x)\propto \exp\left(-\frac{mv_x^2}{2kT}\right)$$
- By _normalising_ the distribution function:
$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{1D}(v_x)\,dv_x=1$$
