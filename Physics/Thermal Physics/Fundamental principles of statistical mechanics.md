# The classical statistics of particles
- For a macroscopic body with a very large number of degrees of freedom, solving for the motion of all of its particles becomes impossible
- A state where all degrees of freedom have a specified value is a _microstate_
- Instead, _statistical laws_ emerge, which adequately describe the behaviour of the system at a whole, and are only applicable to large systems
- Assume all particles obey classical mechanics
- Given a system with $s$ degrees of freedom, a certain state can be denoted by a _phase point_ $(q_1,q_2,...,q_s,p_1,p_2,...,p_s)$ in a $2s-$dimensional [[Analytical classical mechanics#Phase space|phase space]] 

## The statistical distribution function
- Inside a closed system with many particles, consider a subsystem of some particles that freely interacts with the rest
- _Ergodic hypothesis_ - After a sufficiently long time $T$, the subsystem will have been in every possible state, i.e. its phase points will have covered all of the subsystem's phase space
- Let $\Delta t$ be the amount of time it spent in the phase volume $\Delta p \Delta q$, the probability the subsystem is in that volume is $w=\Delta t/T$
- Upon taking the limit of an infinitesimal volume $dp\,dq=dq_1\,dq_2\,...dq_s\,dp_1\,dp_2\,...\,dp_s$ , the probability $dw$ of the subsystem being in the phase interval $(q,p)$ to $(q+dq,p+dp)$ is:
$$dw = \rho(q_1...q_s,p_1...p_s)\,dq\,dp$$
- $\rho(p,q)$ is the _statistical distribution function_, and is (obviously) normalised:
$$\int \rho(p,q)\,dp\,dq=1$$
- The statistical distribution _does not depend on the initial conditions_ of the system, as after a sufficiently long time, it has been through every point in phase space, any of which can be the initial state

## Average values
- The statistical distribution allows us to evaluate the distribution and mean of any variable $f(p,q)$ related to the system as a whole, with the mean being:
$$\overline{f}=\left<f\right>=\int f(p,q)\,\rho(p,q)\,dp\,dq$$
- With the definition of $dw$, it can be seen that this is identical to time averaging
- Statistical mechanics is inherently probabilistic as the initial conditions are not used\
- As macroscopic bodies are observed, all quantities are practically constant and equal to their mean (extremely sharp peak at $f=\bar{f}$)
- A system with physical quantities equal (to a very high accuracy) to the mean value is in a state of _statistical/thermodynamic/thermal equilibrium_
- The time it takes for a perturbed system to equilibriate is the _relaxation time_
- The study of how a system equilibriates is _kinetics_, i.e. **not statistical mechanics**

## Statistical independence and fluctuations

### Statistical independence of multiple subsystems
- Consider the interaction of a subsystem with its surroundings
	- It interacts via particles on the surface
	- The proportion of the subsystem that interacts with the rest decreases with size
	- A large subsystem (still small compared to the rest) can be considered _quasi-closed_ for a short period of time
- Different quasi-closed subsystems within the same closed system can be considered statistically independent
- Let there be 2 subsystems, with volume elements $dp^{(1)}\,dq^{(1)}$ and $dp^{(2)}\,dq^{(2)}$
- If regarded as a composite subsystem $(12)$, as the subsystems are statistically independent:
$$\displaylines{\rho_{12}\,dp^{(12)}\,dq^{(12)} = \rho_1\,dp^{(1)}\,dq^{(1)} \rho_2\,dp^{(2)}\,dq^{(2)} \\ \rho_{12}=\rho_1\rho_2}$$
- Converse: if the above is true for any 2 subsystems, they are statistically independent
- Can hold for any number of small subsystems
- Given a physical quantity $f$, the product of the subsystem means is:
$$\overline{f_1f_2}=\bar{f_1}\bar{f_2}$$
### Fluctuations
- Over time, a macroscopic quantity $f$ will fluctuate around the mean $\bar{f}$
- As it varies in both directions, $\mean{\Delta f}=\mean{f-\bar{f}}=0$
- Instead, the _root-mean-square fluctuation_ $\sqrt{\mean{(\Delta f)^2}}$ is used
$$\mean{(\Delta f)^2}=\overline{f^2}-(\bar{f})^2$$
- The _relative fluctuation_ of a quantity $f$ is $\sqrt{\mean{(\Delta f)^2}}/\bar{f}$ 
- To obtain $f$ for a closed system, one can simply add up the $\bar{f_i}$ for many quasi-closed subsystems:
$$\bar{f} = \sum_{i=1}^N\bar{f_i}$$
- The RMS fluctuation is:
$$\mean{(\Delta f)^2} = \mean{\left(\sum\Delta f_i\right)^2}=\sum \mean{(\Delta f_i)^2} \propto N$$
	- Due to statistical independence, $\mean{\Delta f_i\Delta f_k} = 0$
- As $\bar{f}$ is also proportional to $N$, the relative fluctuation is proportional to $1/\sqrt{N}$
- For a large enough system, the value of $f$ is always close to $\bar{f}$


## Phase space flow and Liouville's theorem
>[!INFO] Liouville's Theorem
For a small, closed region of phase space, its shape will change over time, but the total volume will not
In other words, the distribution function along a phase space trajectory is constant in time
- Consider a _statistical ensemble_ of identical subsystems, represented by a "neighbourhood" of phase points in $2s-$dimensional phase space
- As time progresses, the ensemble of points will still be distributed according to $\rho(q,p)$ at $t=0$
- Proof of unchanging volume: [[Analytical classical mechanics#Liouville's Theorem]]
- Liouville's equation:
$$\pd{\rho}{t}=-\PB{\rho}{\Ham}$$
- Liouville's theorem is valid for any _quasi-closed_ system

## The equal probabilities postulate
- One assumption of statistical thermodynamics is that all microstates are equally likely
- It relies on:
	- The fact that the systems under discussion are in equilibrium
	- The ergodic hypothesis
	- (QM) the principle of detailed balance/ (CM) Liouville's theorem
- Ergodic hypothesis: quantum mechanically, there is some way, direct or indirect, to get from any state to any other
	- "Once the quantum apple has been bitten, the loss of innocence is permanent" - R. Shankar
- Detailed balance: probability of any transition is equal to probability of reverse transition
	- Given states of equal energy $a$ and $b$, the probabilities per unit time $P$ are equal:
	$$P(a\rightarrow b)=P(b\rightarrow a)$$
- The classical proof:
	- In equilibrium, all probabilities are independent of time
	- Only a uniform distribution of points in phase space is consistent with equilibrium and Liouville's theorem

- The quantum mechanical proof:
	- Let each microstate $a$ have a probability $w_a$
	- The rate of change of $w_a$ is:
	$$\dot{w}_a=\sum_bw_bP(b\rightarrow a)-w_a\sum_bP(a\rightarrow b)$$
	- At equilibrium, $w_a$ is constant, and using the principle of detailed balance:
	$$\sum_bP(a\rightarrow b)(w_b-w_a)=0$$
	- The only non-trivial solution is that $w_b=w_a$ for all $a$ and $b$

## Importance of energy in statistical mechanics
- From Liouville's theorem, it is clear that $\rho(q,p)$ is a _constant of motion_ for a quasi-closed subsystem
- For two quasi-closed subsystems, $\rho_{12}=\rho_1\rho_2$
- It follows that $\ln{\rho}$ is an _additive constant of motion_ ($\ln{\rho_{12}}=\ln{\rho_1}+\ln{\rho_2}$)
- In mechanics, the independent additive constants of motion are energy $E$, momentum $\bm{P}$, and angular momentum $\bm{L}$, therefore $\ln{\rho}$ can be expressed as:
	$$\ln{\rho}=\alpha+\beta E(q,p)+\bm{\gamma}\cdot\bm{P}(p)+\bm{\delta}\cdot\bm{L}(q,p)$$
	- $\alpha$ is for normalisation
	- $\beta,\bm{\gamma},\bm{\delta}$ determined from values of $E,\bm{P},\bm{L}$ 
- One can _transform_ into a coordinate system where the total $\bm{P}$ and $\bm{L}$ of the system is zero
- Therefore, $\ln{\rho}$ becomes:
$$\ln{\rho}=\alpha+\beta E(q,p)$$
>[!info] A fundamental principle of statistical mechanics
>The statistical properties of a system can be derived from only the energy (or Hamiltonian)

## The microcanonical ensemble
- The simplest statistical distribution is where $\rho$ is constant for $E=E_0$, and zero everywhere else
- The resulting distribution, known as the _microcanonical ensemble_:
$$\rho=\text{const}\cdot\delta(E-E_0)$$

## Large systems
- Relaxation time increases with the size of the system
- For a large system, small parts of it may attain equilibrium by themselves before the system as a whole
- Each small part can be described by a dsitribution function $\rho$ with their own parameters $(\alpha,\beta,\bm{\gamma},\bm{\delta})$
- Another kind of partial equilibrium may be attained if multiple processes occur at different speeds
	- For a slow chemical reaction, the molecules may reach thermal equilibrium long before chemical equilibrium
- A macrostate describes the mean values of physical quantities, determining a particular partial equilibrium

# The quantum statistics of particles
- Assume all particles _obey quantum mechanics_
- Integrating SchrÃ¶dinger's equation for every particle is impossible

## The practical non-existence of stationary states
- For macroscopic bodies, the energy eigenvalue spectrum is infinite, and extremely dense
- For a given finite range, the number of energy levels increases exponentially with particle number
- The energy of a system is always "broadened" due to interactions with surroundings, with interaction energy >> gap between levels
- The energy-time uncertainty principle:
	- Let there be an interaction between particles last for time $t$, and the energy of one particle before and after the interaction be $E$ and $E'$ respectively
	- Uncertainties: $|\Delta E-\Delta E'| \geq \hbar/\Delta t$
	- For an uncertainty smaller than the energy level gap, and extremely long $\Delta t$ is needed

## The statistical matrix
- To describe an ensemble of particles in a range of states, one must use the [[Density matrix|density matrix]]
- It allows one to calculate means and probabilities of measuring a certain value
- In statistical mechanics, the density matrix of the energy representation, also known as the _statistical matrix_, is used
- For a statistical matrix $\hat{w}$, the mean of a physical quantity $\Omega$ is:
$$\overline{\braket{\Omega}}=\text{Tr}(\hat{\Omega}\hat{w})$$
- The ensemble is never _in_ one of the states of the statistical matrix, as there is no stationary state, the matrix simply a tool to calculate resultant averages of macroscopic quantities
- The statistical matrix is the quantum analogue of [[Fundamental principles of statistical mechanics#The statistical distribution function|the statistical distribution function]] 
- Theorems applied to the classical case, such as relative fluctuations also apply here
- Comparison
	- Classical: direct probability distribution of the system having position and momenta $(q,p)$
	- Quantum: no indication of coordinates and momenta, only probabilities of certain states
		- Coordinates and momenta cannot have definite values simultaneously
- The probability distribution for the coordinate $q$ and momentum $p$ are computed by:
$$\displaylines{dw_q=\text{Tr}(\mathcal{P}_q\hat{w})\,dq=\sum_iw_{i}|\braket{q|E_i}|^2\,dq \\
dw_p=\text{Tr}(\mathcal{P}_p\hat{w}) \,dq=\sum_i}$$
