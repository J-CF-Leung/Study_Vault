## Statistical view of temperature
- When two bodies are in _thermal equilibrium_, they must have the _same temperature_
- _Zeroth law_: if $A$  is in thermal equilibrium with $B$ and $C$, $B$ and $C$ are in thermal equilibrium with each other
	- i.e. The thermodynamic concept of temperature _"makes sense"_
- To understand definition of temperature, let there be 2 bodies in _thermal contact_ with small fluctuations
	- Can exchange $U$, but $N$ and $V$ remain fixed
	- Total microstates = $\Omega_1\Omega_2$
- The _most probable macrostate_ has a _maximum number of microstates_
- One can write:
$$\frac{d}{dU_1}(\Omega_1\Omega_2)=0$$
- From energy conservation $dU_1=-dU_2$:
$$\displaylines{\frac{1}{\Omega_1}\frac{d\Omega_1}{dU_1}-\frac{1}{\Omega_2}\frac{d\Omega_2}{dU_2}=0 \\\frac{d(\ln\Omega)}{dU}=\frac{1}{k_BT}}$$
- This quantity is _the same across two objects_. and $T$ is defined as the _temperature_
- Temperature scales can often be _arbitrary_

- This also defines another _state variable_: _Entropy_
	$$S=k_B\ln\Omega$$
	- $k_B=$ Boltzmann's constant
- A state of _maximum number of microstates_ has _maximum entropy_
