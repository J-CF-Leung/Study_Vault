## Bragg equation
- Consider scattering of X-rays with wavelength $\lambda$ from a series of lattice planes with spacing $d$:
- A sharp peak is seen at angle $\theta$ which satisfies:
$$n\lambda=2d\sin\theta$$
- "Diffraction" from a plane with no atoms (e.g. 200): higher order peak from lattice plane
	- e.g. (200) diffraction peak is second-order (100) peak
- Lattice spacing in a material with orthogonal axes:
$$\frac{1}{d_{hkl}^2}=\frac{h^2}{a^2}+\frac{k^2}{b^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}$$
	- Cubic material: $d=a/\sqrt{N}$, $N=h^2+k^2+l^2$

## Diffraction measurements
- X-ray apparatus: rotates sample by $\theta$ and detector by $2\theta$, outputs $2\theta$
- Powder diffraction: many crystals with different orientations
	- Produces diffraction (Debye-Scherrer) cones with angle $2\theta$ w.r.t. undiffracted beam
