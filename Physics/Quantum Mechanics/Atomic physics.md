- For a _single-electron atom_, see [[The hydrogen atom]]

- Many principles from the single-electron atom can also be applied

# Selection rules
- Consider an atom _absorbing/emitting a photon_ during a transition:
$$\ket{\alpha}\longleftrightarrow \ket{\beta}+\gamma$$

## The hydrogen atom
- For a _hydrogen atom_, the _rate_ of emission or absorption is proportional to:
$$\Gamma\propto\omega^3|\braket{\alpha|\hat{\bm{d}}|\beta}|^2$$
- Here, $\hat{\bm{d}}$ is the _electric dipole operator_:
$$\hat{\bm{d}}=-e\hat{\bm{r}}$$
- As it is a vector operator, use the [[Symmetries in quantum mechanics#The Wigner-Eckart Theorem for vector operators|Wigner-Eckart Theorem]]
- The [[Symmetries in quantum mechanics#Spatial inversion and parity|parity selection rule]] also applies
	- Eliminates $l_1+l_2$ _even_

- For a given emission or absorption:
$$\displaylines{\ket{n_1l_1m_1}\longleftrightarrow\ket{n_2l_2m_2}+\gamma \\\braket{n_1l_1m_1|\hat{\bm{d}}|n_2l_2m_2}\neq0 \text{ iff} \\ \Delta l=\pm1 \hspace{1cm}l_1+l_2\geq1\hspace{1cm}\Delta m_l=0,\pm1}$$
- There are _no restrictions_ on $\Delta n$
