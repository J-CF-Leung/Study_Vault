- The progression of an experiment in physics:
1. Make, or wait for changes to a system
2. Track and measure changes using a device or transducer
	- Turns the physical quantity into a (typically voltage) signal
3. Signal handling (Amplify or filter the signal)
4. Record and analyse the data

- "Junk", noise, and interference can be introduced by measurement devices and transducers
- Approximations, averages, and assumptions during analysis also affect the results

- The transducer should affect the system as little as possible
- The effect of the transducer may not be constant

## Electrical measurements
- An oscilloscope measures the voltage from a transducer

- Consider the transducer represented by a real voltage source
- By Thevenin's theorem, it can be represented by a perfect voltage source $V_1$, in _series_ with an impedance $Z_{out}$

- An oscilloscope is represented by an ideal voltmeter in parallel with an "input impedance" $Z_{in}$
