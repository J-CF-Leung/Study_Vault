- The same mathematical tools as [[Classical Field Theory]]
- There is _no time dependence_, as one studies systems in _equilibrium_
- Instead, one uses _temperature_ as the variable

- Characterise the system under some _coordinates_ $x^i$ and $\varphi(x^i,t)$
- One can study _phase transitions_

- The information of the system is contained in the _partition function_
- For a large number of particles, one uses an _integral_ to calculate it
# Models of a ferromagnet

## Ising model
- Have a _square lattice of spins_
	- Spin: up or down
- Model the Hamiltonian such that it is _energetically favourable to be aligned_

- At _low temperatures_, it is favourable to be _all spin up or down_
- At _high temperatures_, it is favourable to have _random spins_, or _zero magnetisation_
![[Magnetisation crit.png]]
- The _discontinuity_ of the _first derivative_ at $T=T_c$ gives a _second order phase transition_

- Given there is some _external magnetic field_:
![[Ising model B.png]]
- As _temperature_ increases _above_ $T_c$, the _size of discontinuity increases_

- Let there be $d$ dimensions
- Describe the _Hamiltonian_ as a _field_ from $\mathbb{Z}^d$ to
- To make alignment _favourable_:
$$H=$$
- Then calculate the _partition function_, where one sums over _all possible spin configurations_
