- Many principles from [[Special Relativity]] still apply:
	- The laws of physics are _invariant_ across _inertial reference frames_
	- The _speed of causality_ for _all observers_ is the _speed of light in vacuum_ $c$
	- There is _no longer absolute time or simultaneity_
- Like special relativity, laws are written in terms of _geometric objects_, such as _vectors_ and _tensors_

- Notation: [[Einstein notation]]
- Apply the language of [[Special Relativity#Component representation|tensors, covariant and contravariant components]]
# Motivation

## The weak equivalence principle
- _Newtonian_ gravity asserts that the _gravitational force_ felt by an object is determined by some _gravitational potential_ $\Phi_G$
- Let there be some _passive gravitational mass_ $m_G$, the force on it is:
$$\bm{F}=-m_G\nabla\Phi_G$$
- The potential is determined by a _mass density_ $\rho$:
$$\nabla^2\Phi_G=4\pi G\rho$$
- This implies that the potential can _change instantly throughout space_, which is already _inconsistent with special relativity_

- This _mass density_ is _not necessarily required to be the passive gravitational mass_
- Instead, define it as an _active gravitational mass_, where such a point mass has density:
$$\rho(\bm{x},t)=m_A\delta^3(\bm{x}-\bm{y}(t))$$
- Let there be mass $m_{G,1}$ at $\bm{x}_1$ at time $t$, and another mass $m_{A,2}$ at $\bm{x}_2$ also at time $t$, then the corresponding _forces_ are:
$$\displaylines{\bm{F}_{1\text{ on }2}=Gm_{A,1}m_{G,2}\frac{\bm{x}_1-\bm{x}_2}{|\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1|^3}\\\bm{F}_{2\text{ on }1}=Gm_{G,1}m_{A,2}\frac{\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1}{|\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1|^3}}$$
- Due to _momemtum conservation_, they are _equal and opposite_, hence:
$$m_{A,1}m_{G,2}=m_{G,1}m_{A,2}$$
- Therefore, the _ratio_ between $m_A$ and $m_G$ must be _constant for all masses_, and this ratio can be _absorbed_ into the _gravitational constant_ $G$

- Meanwhile, from _Newton's second law_:
$$\bm{F}=m_I\frac{d^2\bm{x}}{dt^2}$$
- where $m_I$ is the _inertial mass_
- Experiment shows that for _all masses_, $m_I/m_G$ is constant, and can be further absorbed into $G$
- This leads to the _weak equivalence principle_:
>[!info] Weak equivalence principle
>Given a gravitational field, the trajectory of a freely falling point mass depends only on their initial position and velocity, and is indepenent of structure or composition
- This is _unique to gravity_, as for _electromagnetic fields_, the trajectory depends on the _ratio between charge and mass_

## The strong equivalence principle
- Further thought experiments led to the _strong equivalence principle_:
>[!info] Strong equivalence principle
>In a small enough region of space, that is non-rotating and free-falling under some gravitational field, the laws of physics reduce to that of special relativity
- An equivalent statement is that it is _impossible to tell using local experiments_ whether one is in a _gravitational field_ or is simply _in an accelerating frame_
- If the region of space is _large_, then one can infer the existence of a gravitational field via _tidal effects_
- The equivalence principle is a _local statement_

>[!quote]
>At that moment I got the happiest thought of my life in the following form: In an example worth considering, the gravitational field has a relative existence only in a manner similar to the electric field generated by magneto-electric induction. _Because for an observer in free-fall from the roof of a house there is during the fall_—at least in his immediate vicinity—_no gravitational field._
>- Einstein in 1920, about his time at a patent office in 1907

## Conclusions
- The equivalence principles suggest that gravitational fields are determined by the _local structure of space-time_
- A _local inertial reference frame_ will still resemble the [[Special Relativity|geometry of special relativity]]
- Gravity manifests itself as the global _curvature of space-time_, caused by the presence of _matter_

- Experimental evidence (gravitational waves, mercury's precession) has shown that for _extreme gravity_, Einsteinian relativity is _much more accurate than Newtonian mechanics_

- The above conclusions motivate the description of spacetime as a _manifold_
- In _special relativity_, _Minkowski spacetime_ is a 4-dimensional manifold
- In _general relativity_, spacetime is a _manifold_ that responds _dynamically_ to mass and energy

# Manifolds, vectors, tensors and geometry
- _Informally_, an $n-$dimensional manifold is a _surface_ on which one can have a _network_ of _coordinate patches_, where the surface _resembles_ $\mathbb{R}^n$, but only _locally_
- In relativity, the _network_ is a set of _events_, and the whole _patch_ is _spacetime_

## Manifolds and coordinates
- Formally, an $n-$dimensional manifold is a _structure consisting of_:
	- A _set_ $\mathcal{M}$ of _points_ $P$
	- A _countable_ family of _subsets of_ $\mathcal{M}$, known as _fundamental coordinate patches_ $C_\alpha$, such that the _union_ of all $C_\alpha$ is the whole set $\mathcal{M}$
	- One can _map_ each $C_\alpha$ to an _open subset of_ $\mathbb{R}^n$, with each point having _coordinates_ $x^a=(x^0,x^1,\dots,x^n)$
- Generally, one is _unable_ to _cover_ the entire manifold with _one non-degenerate patch_
	- Requirement that $C_\alpha$ is mapped onto an _open subset_
- The manifold is _differentiable_ if the patches are joined _smoothly_

- Manifolds are often _embedded_ in some higher-dimensional Euclidean space
	- This is not a _necessary condition_ for a manifold to exist
- An example of a manifold is the _set of 3D rotations_ in space
- Or, a _2-sphere_ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, defined by $x^2+y^2+z^2=a^2$
	- The _spherical polar coordinates_ become _degenerate_ at the poles, so two coordinate patches are required

- The _coordinates_ of a point on a manifold are _not unique_, and can be _transformed_ (e.g. denoted $x^a\to x'^a$)
	- Analagous to the [[Special Relativity#Lorentz transformations|Lorentz transformations]] in special relativity
	- The _point_ itself is unaffacted by transformations as it is a _geometric object_

### Coordinate transformations
- Coordinate transformations are viewed as _passive_, as points are simply _relabelled_
- The map is denoted:
$$x^a\to x'^a=x'^a(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)$$
- Assume the function is _smooth_ and _differentiable_

- Consider two _infinitesimally close points_ $x^a$ and $x^a+dx^a$
- In the _new coordinate system_:
$$dx'^a=\pd{x'^a}{x^b}dx^b$$
- This defines a _transformation matrix_:
$$J^a_b=\pmatrix{\partial x'^1/\partial x^1 & \dots & \partial x'^1/\partial x^n \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \partial x'^1/\partial x^n & \dots & \partial x'^n/\partial x^n}$$
- The _determinant_ $J\equiv\text{det}(J^a_b)$ is known as the _Jacobian_ of the transformation
- If $J\neq0$ for _some range_ of coordinates, the transformation is _locally invertible_:
$$\displaylines{x^a=x^a(x'^1,x'^2,\dots x'^n) \\ \pd{x'^a}{x_b}\pd{x_b}{x'^c}=\delta^a_c}$$
- The _determinant_ of the inverse is then $1/J$
## Structures on a manifold
- Once manifolds are defined, one can support _objects_ on this manifold
	- _Scalar fields_ $\phi(x^a)$
	- _Curves_ $x^\mu(s)$
	- _Surfaces_ $x^\mu(s^1,s^2,\dots s^m)$
	- _Tangent vectors_ $dx^\mu/ds|_{s_0}$ _along a curve_
	- _Tangent spaces_, a collection of _tangent vectors for all curves passing through a point $s_0$_, which forms a _vector space_, with the _same dimension_ as the _manifold_

- A _scalar field_ is the simplest structure, a _map_ assigning each point $P$ a _number_ (real or complex), which can be expressed as a _function of coordinates_ $\phi(x^a)$
- This value is _independent of coordinate system_
- Therefore, if one performs a _coordinate transformation_ $x_a\to x'^a$, one must define a _new function_:
$$\phi(x^a)=\phi'(x'^a)$$
### Curves and surfaces
- Curves and surfaces are _subsets_ of points on a manifold
- A _curve_ is defined _parametrically_, with a single parameter:
$$x^\mu=x^\mu(s)$$
- Meanwhile, a _surface_, or _submanifold_ of dimensionality $m$ requires $m$ parameters:
	- $m<n$, the dimensionality of the embedding space
$$x^\mu=x^\mu(s^1,s^2,\dots s^m)$$
- The _special case_ $m=n-1$ is known as a _hypersurface_
- One is able to _eliminate_ the parameters from the $n$ equations, such that there is _some function_ $f$:
$$f(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)=0$$

- Similarly, for some $m-$dimensional surface, one can have $n-m$ constraints:
$$f_1(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)=0,\dots, f_{n-m}(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)=0$$
- This is the _intersection_ of $n-m$ hypersurfaces, as an _alternative to the parametric representation_
### Vectors and the tangent space
- On a manifold, _vectors_ are _associated with the points themselves_
	- In other words, they are _local_
	- Vectors from _one point to another_ will _have no meaning_ as _parallel displacement is not possible_ on a _curved manifold_
	- This also means one _cannot add vectors associated with different points_
- They must be _defined_ as being an element of the _tangent space_ at that point
	- It is an $n-$dimensional _subspace_ of the embedding space
	- One can also define the _tangent bundle_ for manifold $M$, denoted $T(M)$, which is the _set of all tangent spaces_, forming a $2n-$dimensional manifold 

- One must define the _tangent space_ using objects _intrinsic to the manifold_ $M$
- Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the _space of all smooth functions_ on the manifold
	- $C^\infty$ maps $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ 
- Any _curve_ passing through some point $p$ defines a _directional derivative_ $f\to df/ds|_p$

- The _tangent space_ $T_p$ is then the _space of directional derivative operators along curves_
	- One can demonstrate that the operators fulfill the requirement for a _vector space_

- The _basis_ of a tangent space is the set of vectors $\hat{e}_\mu=\partial_\mu=\partial/\partial x^\mu$
	- _Any_ directional derivative is a _linear combination_ of $\{\partial_\mu\}$
$$\vec{V}=V^\mu\pd{}{x^\mu}$$

- From the _chain rule_, one gets the _transformation law_ for basis vectors:
$$\partial_{\mu'}=\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\partial_\mu$$
- One then gets the _transformation law for components_ of vector $V=V^\mu\partial_\mu$:
$$\displaylines{V^\mu\partial_\mu=V^{\mu'}\partial_{\mu'}=V^{\mu'}\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\partial_\mu \\ V^{\mu'}=\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\mu}V^\mu}$$
- This transformation is _not necessarily linear_

- The _components_ of basis vectors is as expected:
$$\hat{e}_{\mu}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}=\frac{\partial x^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\nu}} \implies \left( \hat{e}_{\mu} \right)^{\nu}=\delta_{\mu}^{\nu}$$

- The _tangent vector_ to a curve $x^a(u)$ can then be defined:
$$\frac{d}{du}=\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\pd{}{x^\mu}$$
- These vectors are _contravariant_

### The vector commutator
- As vectors are thought of as _directional derivatives_, one can define a _commutator_, acting on some _function_:
$$[X,Y](f)\equiv X(Y(f))-Y(X(f))$$
- The _explicit expression_:
$$[X,Y]^\mu=X^\lambda \partial_\lambda Y^\mu-Y^\lambda\partial_\lambda X^\mu$$
- The partial derivative is _not a tensor_, but this can be resolved by _redefining_ the derivative used in the expression
- The result is then a _vector_

### Covariant/dual vectors
- One can define _covariant vectors_
- For example, the _gradient_ of a _scalar field_:
$$X_\mu=\pd{\phi}{x^\mu}$$
- The _component transformation_:
$$X_{\mu'}=\pd{\phi'}{x^{\mu'}}=\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{\phi}{x^\nu}=\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\mu'}}X_\nu$$
- This is a _covariant vector_, which inabits the _dual space_ to that of the contravariant vectors

- The _basis_ in this dual space are then the _gradients_ $\hat{e}^\mu=dx^\mu$
	- One can verify that they are _orthonormal_ to the other basis:
	$$\hat{e}^\mu\cdot\hat{e}_\nu=\pd{x^\mu}{x^\nu}={\delta^\mu}_\nu$$

- _Summing_ a product of _contravariant_ and _covariant_ vectors makes a _scalar_, which is _invariant under transformations_:
$$X_{\mu'}V^{\mu'}=\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\lambda}X_\nu V^\lambda={\delta^\nu}_\lambda X_\nu V^\lambda=X_\nu V^\nu$$
## The metric tensor
- The _geometry_ of a manifold is defined by its _metric_
- Consider two _neighbouring points_ on a manifold, with coordinates $x^\mu$ and $x^\mu+dx^\mu$
- The _local geometry_ there is given by the _interval_

- On a _Riemannian manifold_, the interval takes the form:
$$ds^2=g_{\mu\nu}(x)dx^\mu dx^\nu$$
- The interval is _quadratic in coordinate differentials_
- $g_{\mu\nu}$ are components of the _metric tensor_
	- Each component is known as a _metric function_, which is _dependent on the point onb the manifold_ at which it is evaluated
	- Components are _dependent on coordinate system_

- The geometry is _Riemannian_ if $ds^2>0$, and _pseudo-Riemannian_ if not
- Example: the _Minkowski metric_ $\eta_{\mu\nu}$, where $ds^2=dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2$

- The metric can always be chosen as _symmetric_
	- The _antisymmetric_ part contributes _zero to the interval_
- From this, for an $N-$dimensional manifold, there are $N(N+1)/2$ _independent metric functions_ at each point
- If the metric is _diagonal_ $(g_{\mu\nu}=0\;\; \forall\mu\neq\nu)$, the coordinate system is _orthogonal_
	- Example: The Minkowski metric

- As the interval is _invariant under transformations_:
$$\displaylines{ds^2=g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu=g_{\mu'\nu'}\,dx^{\mu'}dx^{\nu'} \\ g_{\mu'\nu'}(x')=\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\nu'}}\,g_{\mu\nu}(x(x'))}$$
- As there are $N$ _arbitrary_ coordinate transformations one can perform, there are only $N(N-1)/2$ _independent functional degrees of freedom_ for the tensor

### Square of the tangent vector
- The [[#Curves and surfaces|tangent vector]] to a curve $x^\mu(u)$:
$$\frac{d}{du}=\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\pd{}{x^\mu}$$
- Then take the _squared length_:
$$g\left(\frac{d}{du},\frac{d}{du}\right)=g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\frac{dx^\nu}{du}$$
- On a _pseudo-Riemannian manifold_:
$$g\left(\frac{d}{du},\frac{d}{du}\right)=\begin{cases}>0&\text{ if timelike} \\ <0 &\text{ if spacelike} \\ =0&\text{ if null}\end{cases}$$
- Therefore, a curve can be _classified_ as [[Special Relativity#Light cone structure|timelike, null, or spacelike]] based on the metric
- For a _non-null_ curve, the _length_ of the tangent vector is the _derivative_ of the _proper path length_ $s$ w.r.t. $u$:
$$\left|\frac{ds}{du}\right|=\left|g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\right|$$
## Local geometry
- The _intrinsic geometry_ of a manifold is characterised by the _line element_
	- It is _independent_ of any _embedding_ in higher-dimensional space

- Example: a _cylindrical surface_ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$
	- The interval is $ds^2=dz^2+ad\phi^2$
	- It is _locally identical_ to a 2D plane, as one can make a _transformation_ $ds^2=dz'^2+dy'^2$
	- This transformation can be made _everywhere_, as a _2D sheet_ can be _continuously rolled_ into a cylinder, so its _intrinsic geometry_ is said to be _identical to the Euclidean plane_
	- The _extrinsic geometry_ is seen in $\mathbb{R}^3$, where it is _curved_
- Example: a _2-sphere_ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$
	- The interval is $ds^2=a^2d\theta^2+a^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2$
	- While it is _locally identical_, the transformation _cannot be made over the whole sphere_
	- The sphere is _intrinsically curved_
	![[2-sphere.png]]

- Generally, relativity deals with _intrinsic geometry_, which is _independent of embedding_
- While the _topology_ of the manifold is _intrinsic_, it is _non-local_, and hence _irrelevant to general relativity_

### The 2-sphere and 3-sphere
- Let there be a _2-sphere_, embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by:
$$x^2+y^2+z^2=a$$
- The _line element_ in _3-space_ is $ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+dz^2$

- From the definition of the 2-sphere, one gets the _constraint_ $xdx+ydy+zdz=0$
- Substituting $dz$, one gets the _induced line element_:
$$ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+\frac{(xdx+ydy)^2}{a^2-(x^2+y^2)}$$
- Using _plane polar coordinates_ (on the _tangent plane_):
$$\displaylines{x=\rho\cos\phi\hspace{1.5cm}y=\rho\cos\phi \\ ds^2=\frac{a^2}{a^2-\rho^2}d\rho^2+\rho^2d\phi^2}$$
- Thus, one gets the _induced metric_
- There is a _singularity_ at $\rho=a$ 
	- This corresponds to the _equator relative to the point_ at which $ds$ is evaluated
![[2-sphere polars.png]]

- Next, consider the _3-sphere_, embedded in $\mathbb{R}^4$:
$$x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2=a^2$$
- Similarly, the _induced line element_ is:
$$ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+dz^2+\frac{(xdx+ydy+zdz)^2}{a^2-(x^2+y^2+z^2)}$$
- Similarly, using _spherical polar coordinates_ in the tangent space:
$$ds^2=\frac{a^2}{a^2-r^2}dr^2+r^2d\theta^2+r^2\sin^2\theta \,d\phi^2$$
- This describes a _non-Euclidean_ 3D space
- For $a\to\infty$, one recovers _3D Euclidean space_
	- For $r\ll a$, $\mathbb{R}^3$ is recovered _locally_

- One should not try to visualise the 3-sphere
## Lengths and volumes
- Consider sume _curve_ $x^\mu(u)$ between points $A$ and $B$ on some manifold
- Since $ds^2=g_{\mu\nu}x^\mu x^\nu$ is the _invariant distance_ between neighbouring points, the _length along a curve_ is:
$$L_{AB}=\int_{u_A}^{u_B} \left|g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\right|^{1/2}du$$

- For the _volume_ of some region, assume a _diagonal_ metric, where $g_{\mu\nu}=0$ if $\mu\neq\nu$:
	- Consider the _sides_ of the element with length $ds=\sqrt{g_{ii}}dx^i$
$$dV=\sqrt{|g_{11}g_{22}\dots g_{NN}|}\,dx^1dx^2\dots dx^N$$
- The quantity in square root is the _determinant_ of the metric tensor
	- One can check that it transforms as $g'=g/J^2$, where $J$ is the [[#Coordinate transformations|Jacobian]]
- The product of differentials transforms as $dx^{1'}dx^{2'}\dots = Jdx^1dx^2\dots$
- Hence, one sees that the volume element is _invariant_:
$$dV=\sqrt{|g|}\,dx^1dx^2\dots dx^N$$
## Local Cartesian Coordinates on Riemannian manifolds
- On a _Riemannian_ manifold, it is _generally not possible_ to choose coordinates such that the _line element_ is in a _Euclidean form_ at _every point_ (i.e. make the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}=\delta_{\mu\nu}$)
	- There are $N(N+1)/2$ _independent functions_ but only $N$ _transformations_

- However, it is possible to make it _Euclidean for a small area around some given point_
- This condition corresponds to:
$$\displaylines{g_{\mu\nu}(P)=\delta_{\mu\nu}\hspace{1.5cm}\pd{g_{\mu\nu}}{x^\rho}\Bigg|_P=0 \\ g_{\mu\nu}=\delta_{\mu\nu}+O[(x-x_P)^2]}$$
- These are the _local Cartesian coordinates_ at point $P$

- Consider the _Taylor expansion_ of the _coordinate transformation_
- One can show that since $g_{\mu\nu}'$ has $N(N+1)/2$ _independent values_, and the _coordinates_ ${\partial x'^\rho}/{\partial x'^\sigma}$ has $N^2$ _degrees of freedom_, one can _fix_ $g'_{\mu\nu}$ and still have $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom _remaining_
- Similarly, $\partial g_{\mu\nu}/\partial x^\rho$ has $N^2(N+1)/2$ _independent values_, and the _coordinates_ $\partial x'^\mu/\partial x^\rho\partial x^\sigma$ have $N^2(N+1)/2$ degrees of freedom, one can _fix_ $\partial g'_{\mu\nu}/\partial x^\rho$

- However, the _second derivatives of the metric cannot be eliminated_, and these terms give rise to the _curvature_ of the manifold 
## Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
- For a _pseudo-Riemannian manifold_, $ds^2$ can be _zero or negative_
- This implies that the _eigenvalues_ of $g_{\mu\nu}$ can be _negative_

- One can find _local coordinates_ such that at some point:
$$\displaylines{g_{\mu\nu}(P)=\eta_{\mu\nu}=\text{diag}(\pm1,\pm1,\dots\pm1) \\ \pd{g_{\mu\nu}}{x^\rho}\Bigg|_P=0}$$
- The _signature_ of the manifold is the number of _positive_ entries _minus_ the number of _negative_ entries

- Example: _Minkowski spacetime_
$$\displaylines{ds^2=c^2dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2 \\ g_{\mu\nu}=\text{diag}(+1,-1,-1,-1)}$$

### Locally inertial coordinates
- When the coordinates resemble $\eta_{\mu \nu}$ _locally_, where $\eta_{\mu \nu}$ is the _Minkowski metric_:
$$\eta_{\mu \nu}=\text{diag}(+1,-1,-1,-1)$$

- These are _locally inertial coordinates_
- They correspond to some _inertial frame_ in special relativity

- The metric is _invariant_ under any _change of basis corresponding to a Lorentz transformation
	- Still only makes sense _locally_
- Hence, it is _not unique_
# Tensor algebra
- At a given point $P$ on the manifold, one can define a _tensor_, a _multilinear map_
- A $(k,l)$ tensor takes $k$ _contravariant_ vectors and $l$ _covariant_ vectors to produce a _scalar_
	- The tensor is said to have _rank $k+l$_
	- Tensor _components_ can be said to be completely _covariant, contravariant, or mixed_
- The linearity of a type $(1,1)$ tensor:
$$\begin{aligned}T(\alpha W_\mu+\beta X_\mu,\gamma V^\nu+\delta Z^\nu)&=\alpha\gamma \,T(W_\mu,V^\nu)+\alpha\delta\,T(W_\mu,Z^\nu) \\ &+ \beta\gamma \,T(X_\mu,V^\nu)+\beta\delta\,T(X_\mu,Z^\nu)\end{aligned}$$
- Like _vectors_, tensors are _geometric objects_ that are _coordinate independent_

- Its _components_ in some given basis are:
$${T^{\mu_1\dots \mu_k}}_{\nu_1\dots \nu_l}=T(dx^{\mu_1},\dots dx^{\mu_k},\partial_{\nu_1},\dots\partial_{\nu_l})$$
- Like _vector components_, tensor components can also be _transformed_:
$${T^{\mu_1'\dots \mu_k'}}_{\nu_1'\dots \nu_l'}=\pd{x^{\mu_1'}}{x^{\mu_1}}\dots \pd{x^{\mu_k'}}{x^{\mu_k}}\pd{x^{\nu_1}}{x^{\nu_1'}}\dots \pd{x^{\nu_l}}{x^{\nu_l'}}{T^{\mu_1\dots \mu_k}}_{\nu_1\dots \nu_l}$$
	- The _primed coordinates_ remain _"upstairs/downstairs" on both sides_
## Tensor operations
- _Addition_ is done _by component_:
$$(T+S)_{\mu\nu}=T_{\mu\nu}+S_{\mu\nu}$$
- One can check that this _still obeys the transformation law_

- The _outer product_ of a $(p,q)$ tensor and an $(r,s)$ tensor produces a $(p+r,q+s)$ _tensor_
- The outer product of $S$ and $T$ is _denoted_ $S\otimes T$, with _components_:
$${(S\otimes T)^{\lambda_1\dots\lambda_p\mu_1\dots\mu_r}}_{\nu_1 \dots\nu_q\xi_1\dots\xi_s}={S^{\lambda_1\dots\lambda_p}}_{\nu_1 \dots\nu_q}{T^{\mu_1\dots\mu_r}}_{\xi_1\dots\xi_s}$$
- For example, the _outer product of two contravariant vectors_ creates a $(2,0)$ _tensor_

- The operation of _contraction_ sets a _contravariant_ and _covariant_ index _equal_, then proceeds to _sum_ them
- A $(k,l)$ tensor is _contracted_ to a $(k-1,l-1)$ tensor
- The tensor $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\nu}$ has _possible contractions_ $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\lambda}$, $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\lambda}{\nu}$, and $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\mu}$
	- They all form _vectors_, either _covariant or contravariant_
	- In general, these are _not equal_
- A _contraction_ of $(1,1)$ tensor $V^\mu X_\nu$ is a _scalar_

### Expansion of a tensor
- The _components_ of a tensor:
$${T^{\mu_1\dots \mu_k}}_{\nu_1\dots \nu_l}=T(dx^{\mu_1},\dots dx^{\mu_k},\partial_{\nu_1},\dots\partial_{\nu_l})$$
- This can be expressed using the _outer product_:
$$T=\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}(\partial_{\mu_1}\otimes\dots\otimes\partial_{\mu_k}, dx^{\nu_1}\otimes\dots\otimes dx^{\nu_l})$$

## Symmetry and antisymmetry
- A type $(0,2)$ tensor $S_{\mu\nu}$ is _symmetric if_ $S_{\mu\nu}=S_{\nu\mu}$
- It is _antisymmetric_ if $S_{\mu\nu}=-S_{\nu\mu}$

- One can _decompose_ any second-rank tensor into _symmetric and anti-symmetric parts_:
$$S_{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}+S_{\nu\mu})+\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}-S_{\nu\mu})$$
- One can denote the _symmetric and anti-symmetric parts_ by:
$$S_{(\mu\nu)}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}+S_{\nu\mu}) \hspace{1.5cm} S_{[\mu\nu]}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}-S_{\nu\mu})$$
- One can then _generalise_ this to an $n-$th rank tensor:
$$\displaylines{S_{(\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n)}=\frac{1}{n!}(S_{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n}+S_{\mu_2\mu_1\dots\mu_n}+\dots) \\ S_{[\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n]}=\frac{1}{n!}(S_{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n}-S_{\mu_2\mu_1\dots\mu_n}+\dots)}$$
- The first sum is over _all possible permutations_
- The second sum is an _alternating sum_, with a _negative sign for odd permutations_
- $1/n!$ is a _normalising factor_ such that for a _totally symmetric matrix_, $S_{(\mu_1\mu_2\dots)}=S_{\mu_1\mu_2\dots}$

- One can also _symmetrise over a subset of indices_:
$$S_{(\lambda\mu)\nu}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\lambda\mu\nu}+S_{\mu\lambda\nu})$$
- Symmetrisation can only take place _among only covariant or contravariant indices_
- The symmetry of the tensor is _independent of coordinate basis_

## Quotient theorem
- _Not all_ sets of quantities labelled with indices are _necessarily tensor components_
- Tensors must satisfy some _quotient relation_

- If a set of quantities, when _contracted_ with an _arbitrary tensor_ produces _another tensor_, the _original set must form the components of a tensor_
- Example: a set of quantities $\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}$, contracted with vector $V^\alpha$:
$$\displaylines{\tenscom{T'}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}v'^\nu=\pd{x^{\lambda'}}{x^\lambda}\pd{x_{\mu'}}{x_\mu}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}V^{\nu}=\pd{x^{\lambda'}}{x^\lambda}\pd{x_{\mu'}}{x_\mu}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}\left(V^{\nu'}\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\nu'}}\right) \\ \tenscom{T'}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}=\pd{x^{\lambda'}}{x^\lambda}\pd{x_{\mu'}}{x_\mu}\pd{x_{\nu'}}{x_\nu}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}}$$
## The metric tensor revisited
- From the above, it is clear that the _metric tensor_ is type $(0,2)$
- Hence it is a _bilinear map_ from a _pair of vectors_ to a _real number_
- One can then use it to define an _inner product_ between vectors:
$$g(a,b)=g_{\mu\nu}a^\mu b^\nu$$

### Index kung-fu and the inverse metric
- It can also be used to _map vectors to co-vectors_:
$$V_\mu\equiv g_{\mu\nu}V^\nu$$
- This is known as _lowering the index_
- One can also change the _type of a tensor_:
$$T_{\mu\nu}=g_{\mu\lambda}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\nu}$$

- One can define an _inverse metric_:
$$(g^{-1})^{\lambda\mu}g_{\mu\nu}=\delta^\lambda_\nu$$
- One can prove that this _obeys tensor transformation laws_
- It is often simply denoted $g^{\lambda\mu}$
- This is consistent with _index lowering_:
$$g_{\mu\rho}g_{\nu\sigma}g^{\rho\sigma}=g_{\rho\mu}\tenscom{\delta}{\rho}{\nu}=g_{\mu\nu}$$

- In other words, the _inverse metric_ is used to _map co-vectors to vectors_:
$$V^\mu\equiv g^{\mu\nu}V_\nu$$
- This is known as _raising the index_

- By applying the metric, then its _inverse_, one recovers the _original object_

- One can raise and lower indices on general tensors:
$$\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\nu}=T_{\rho\sigma\nu}g^{\rho\lambda}g^{\sigma\mu}=T^{\lambda\mu\rho}g_{\rho\nu}$$

- If one _raises only one index of the metric_, one gets:
$$\tenscom{g}{\mu}{\nu}=\delta^\mu_\nu$$
- This follows from the _definition of the inverse metric_ $g^{\mu\lambda}g_{\lambda\nu}=\delta^\mu_\nu$
- One can show that _its components are the same in any coordinate system_

## The inner product
- Using the definitions above, one can rewrite the _inner product_:
$$g_{\mu\nu}a^\mu b^\nu=g^{\mu\nu}a_\mu b_\nu=a_\nu b^\nu=a^\nu b_\nu$$
- On a _Riemannian manifold_, the $a^\nu a_\nu\geq0$, with _equality iff $a$_ is the _null vector_
- On a _pseudo-Riemannian manifold_, $a^\nu b_\nu$ can be _zero or negative_

- One can define a _generalised length_ of a vector as:
$$|v|=|g_{\mu\nu}V^\mu V^\nu|^{1/2}$$
- One can also define a _generalised angle_ $\theta$:
$$\cos\theta=\frac{a_\mu b^\nu}{|a||b|}$$
- On a _pseudo-Riemannian manifold_, $|\cos\theta|>1$ is _possible_

- If $\cos\theta$ _vanishes_, then the vectors are _orthogonal_

# Vector and tensor calculus on manifolds
- On a _manifold_, as vectors and tensors inhibit _different tangent spaces_, there is _no unique way_ to _compare_ vectors/tensors at different points
	- Due to _difference in basis_

- For a _scalar field_, its _gradient_ $\partial\phi/\partial x^\mu$ is a [[#Covariant/dual vectors|covector]]
	- It can be made into a vector by _raising the index_
	- It _maps_ some vector displacement $dx^\nu$ into an _infinitesimal change in the scalar_

## Covariant derivatives and the connection
- In _Euclidean space_, the _derivatives_ of tensor components are with respect to _global Cartesian coordinates_
- It _preserves_ the tensorial nature of the object (_transforming_ in the same way)

- One can see that when applying the "typical" formula for a _gradient of a vector_
$$\pd{V^{\mu'}}{x^{\nu'}}=\pd{x^\lambda}{x^{\nu'}}\pd{}{x^\lambda}\left(V^\mu\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\mu}\right)=\pd{x^\lambda}{x^{\nu'}}\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\mu}\pd{V^\mu}{x^\lambda}+\pd{x^\lambda}{x^{\nu'}}\pd{^2x^{\mu'}}{x^\lambda x^\mu}V^\mu$$
- The _first term_ is the transformation for a type $(1,1)$ tensor, but the _latter term_ is extra
- Hence, this object is _not a tensor_

- The second term is due to _change in the basis vector_
### Covariant derivative of a vector
- One must create a _covariant derivative_ with the properties:
	- For a type $(k,l)$ tensor $\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}$, the covariant derivative $\nabla_\lambda \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}$ must be a _type_ $(k,l+1)$ tensor
	- When acting on a _scalar field_ $\phi$, it must create the _gradient_ of that field $\partial\phi/\partial x^\mu$
	- _Linearity_: for tensors of the same type $T$ and $S$, and _constants_ $\alpha$ and $\beta$:
	$$\nabla_\mu(\alpha T+\beta S)=\alpha\nabla_\mu T+\beta\nabla_\mu S$$
	- The _product rule_:
	$$\nabla_\mu(T\otimes S)=(\nabla_\mu T)\otimes S+T\otimes(\nabla_\mu S)$$

- To eliminate the extra term, let the _covariant derivative_ be _defined_:
$$\nabla_\mu V^\nu=\partial_\mu V^\nu+\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}V^{\lambda}$$
- The coefficients are _components_ of a _set of $n$ matrices_ $\tenscom{(\Gamma_\mu)}{\nu}{\lambda}$
	- One matrix for each _direction_ $\mu$
	- For an $n-$dimensional manifold, there are $n^3$ "components"
- They are the _connection coefficients_
	- They _connect_ different areas of the manifold, by accounting for the _change of basis_

- From _transforming_ both sides of the equation, one sees that $\tenscom{(\Gamma_\mu)}{\nu}{\lambda}$ is _not a tensor_
	- Purposeful, as the _extra terms_ make sure the transformation is valid
$$\Gamma^{\nu'}_{\mu'\lambda'}=\pd{x^{\nu'}}{x^\nu}\pd{x^{\mu}}{x^{\mu'}} \pd{x^{\lambda}}{x^{\lambda'}}\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}+\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{x^\lambda}{x^{\lambda'}}\pd{^2x^{\nu'}}{x^\mu\partial x^\lambda}$$
- One can also see that the tensor is _not unique_ as it only has to satisfy the above
	- The _difference_ of two connections $\Gamma$ and $\tilde{\Gamma}$, their _difference_ transforms as a type $(1,2)$ tensor
	- Hence, it is _unique up to_ a type $(1,2)$ tensor

- The covariant derivative can be interpreted as a _term for change in component_, and a _term for change in basis_
	- The component is a _function_, hence only the _partial derivative_ is used
$$\begin{align}\nabla_{\mu}\left( V^{\nu}\hat{e}_{\nu} \right)&=(\partial_{\mu}V^{\nu})\hat{e}_{\nu}+V^{\nu}\nabla_{\mu}\hat{e}_{\nu} \\ &= (\partial_{\mu}V^{\nu})\hat{e}_{\nu}+V^{\nu}\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu \nu}\hat{e}_{\lambda} \\ &=(\partial_{\mu}V^{\nu}+\Gamma^{\nu}_{\mu\lambda}V^{\lambda})\hat{e}_{\nu} \end{align}$$

### Generalising the covariant derivative
- For _covectors_, there may be a _different connection_:
$$\nabla_\mu\omega_\nu=\partial_\mu\omega_\nu+\tilde{\Gamma}^\lambda_{\mu\nu}\omega_\lambda$$

- Then one must define a covariant derivative with _two new properties_:
	- It must _commute with contractions_:
	$$\nabla_\mu \tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\lambda\rho}=\tenscom{(\nabla T)_\mu}{\;\lambda}{\lambda\rho}$$
	- For a _scalar_, it reduces to the _partial derivative_:
	$$\nabla_\mu\phi=\partial_\mu\phi$$
- The first is equivalent to requiring $\nabla_\mu\delta^\lambda_\rho=0$ (The _Kronecker Delta_ is _covariantly constant_)

- By considering the covariant derivative of a _scalar_ $\nabla_\mu(\omega_\lambda V^\lambda)$:
$$\displaylines{\tilde{\Gamma}^\nu_{\mu\lambda}=-\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda} \\ \nabla_\mu\omega_\lambda=\partial_\mu\omega_\lambda-\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}\omega_\nu}$$

- Then, the _general expression_ for the connection can be built up:
$$\begin{aligned}\nabla_\sigma \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l}&=\partial_\sigma \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l} \\ &+\Gamma^{\mu_1}_{\sigma\lambda}\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l} + \Gamma^{\mu_2}_{\sigma\lambda}\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\lambda\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l}+\dots \\ &-\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_1}\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\lambda\nu_2\dots\nu_l} - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_2}\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\lambda\dots\nu_l}-\dots\end{aligned}$$
- Convenient _notation_:
$$\nabla_\sigma \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l}\equiv \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l;\sigma}$$

### The torsion tensor
- From the discussion above, consider the fact that _any connection_ can be written as a _combination_ of some _fiducial connection_ with a _type $(1,2)$ tensor_:
$$\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}=\hat{\Gamma}^\lambda_{\mu\nu}+\tenscom{S}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}$$
- Then consider the fact that by _permuting lower indices_, one can form _another connection_ (as the non-tensorial term has _commut-able partial derivatives_)

- Then define the _torsion tensor_:
$$\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}=\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}-\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\mu}=2\Gamma^\lambda_{[\mu\nu]}$$
- It is clearly _antisymmetric_
## The metric connection
- Define a _unique connection_, on a manifold with _metric_ $g_{\mu\nu}$
	- Let it be _torsion-free_: $$\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}=\Gamma^\lambda_{(\mu\nu)}$$
	- Let it be _metric compatible_:
	$$\nabla_\rho g_{\mu\nu}=0$$
- From this, one also gets that the _inverse metric is covariantly constant_
- Metric compatibility also means the _covariant derivative commutes with index raising/lowering_:
$$g_{\mu\lambda}\nabla_\rho V^\lambda=\nabla_\rho(g_{\mu\lambda}V^\lambda)=\nabla_\rho V_\mu$$

- By considering the _cyclic permutations_ of the metric compatibility, and subtracting two of the equations from the third, one can _solve for the metric connection_:
$$\displaylines{\partial_\rho g_{\mu\nu}=\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\mu} g_{\lambda\nu}+\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\nu}g_{\mu\lambda}\\\Gamma^\sigma_{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}g^{\sigma\rho}(\partial_\mu g_{\nu\rho}+\partial_\nu g_{\rho\mu}-\partial_\rho g_{\mu\nu})}$$
- These are also called _Christoffel symbols_

- From the first equation above:
$$g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\rho g_{\mu\nu}=2\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\lambda}$$
- Using _Jacobi's formula_ $|\dunderline{M}|^{-1}\partial_\rho|\dunderline{M}|=\text{Tr}(\dunderline{M}^{-1}\partial_\rho\dunderline{M})$:
$$\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\lambda}=\frac{1}{2}g^{-1}\partial_\rho g=\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_\rho \sqrt{|g|}$$

- One can also obtain them from the [[#Geodesics, proper time, and affine parameters|geodesic equation]] with the Lagrangian method
### For local Cartesian coordinates
- For _any metric_, one can make it [[#Local Cartesian Coordinates on Riemannian manifolds|locally Cartesian]]
- As the _derivatives vanish_, one gets that _the metric connection vanishes_
- In this case, the _covariant derivative reduces to partial differentiation_

### The divergence, curl, and Laplacian
- One can define a _covariant divergence_:
$$\nabla_\mu V^\mu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_\lambda\left(\sqrt{|g|}V^\lambda\right)$$
- The _curl_ of some _dual vector field_ $X$ is defined as the _antisymmetric part_ of the covariant derivative:
$$(\text{curl }X)_{\mu\nu}=\nabla_\mu X_\nu-\nabla_\nu X_\mu=\partial_\mu X_\nu-\partial_\nu X_\mu$$
- One can prove that this is _independent of connection_
- The _curl of a gradient vanishes_ 

- The _Laplacian operator_ is then:
$$\nabla^2\phi=\nabla_\mu(g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\nu\phi)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_\mu(\sqrt{g}\,g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu\phi)$$
### The commutator
- Recall the [[#The vector commutator|commutator of two vectors]]
- To make it a _vector_, redefine:
$$[X,Y]^\mu=X^\lambda\nabla_\lambda Y^\mu-Y^\lambda \nabla_\lambda X^\mu$$
- This is _only applicable to the metric connection_
## The intrinsic derivative along a curve
- One often needs to take _derivatives of vectors along a curve_
- Consider some vector $V(u)$ along some _curve_ $x^\mu(u)$

- The _intrinsic derivative_ of the vector along the curve is then:
$$\frac{DV^\mu}{Du}\equiv\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\nabla_\nu V^\mu=\frac{dx^\nu}{du}(\partial_\nu V^\mu+\Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda}V^\lambda)$$
- Contracting the first term:
$$\frac{DV^\mu}{Du}=\frac{dV^\mu}{du}+\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda}V^\lambda$$
- The _first term_ is the _ordinary derivative_, which _does not transform as a vector_
- Therefore, one needs the _connection term_

- This can be extended to _tensors_
- Example: type $(1,1)$
$$\frac{D\tenscom{T}{\mu}{\nu}}{Du}=\frac{d\tenscom{T}{\mu}{\nu}}{du}+\frac{dx^\rho}{du}(\Gamma^\mu_{\rho\lambda}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\nu}-\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\nu}\tenscom{T}{\mu}{\lambda})$$
## Parallel transport
- The _covariant derivative_ will _compare_ the vectors/tensors at different points after they are _parallel transported_ to the same point
- _Parallel transportation_ keeps the vector/tensor _constant_, while moving it _along a curve_
![[Parallel transport.png]]
- In _Euclidean space_, this is given by $dV^\mu/du=0$
- On a _manifold_, parallel transport of a vector $V^\mu$ is given by:
$$\frac{DV^\mu}{Du}=0$$
- This also applies to _tensors_:
$$\frac{D\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l}}{Du}=0$$
- One can see that the parallel transport is _dependent on the path taken_
	- The vectors live in _different tangent spaces_
![[Parallel transport sphere.png|400]]
- One can check that for a _given path_, transport is _independent of parametrisation_
- One can also check that $D|V|^2/Du=0$ for parallel transport

- Parallel transport is also _dependent on connection_
- If the connection is _metric compatible_, the metric is _parallel transported_
- One can then check that the _inner product of two parallel transported vectors_ is _conserved_

## Geodesics, proper time, and affine parameters
- A geodesic is an _extremal path_ between two points on a manifold
	- A _generalisation_ of straight lines
- They can also be defined as curves that _parallel transport vectors_

- The condition of _parallel transporting the tangent vector_:
$$\displaylines{\frac{Dt^\mu}{Du}=\frac{D}{Du}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}=0 \\ \frac{d^2x^\mu}{du^2}+\Gamma^\mu_{\rho\sigma}\frac{dx^\rho}{du}\frac{dx^\sigma}{du}=0}$$
- This is the _geodesic equation_

### Extremising proper time
- Geodesics are also paths of _maximum proper time_
	- Proper time is an _invariant property_
	- For _any timelike path_, one can construct a similar _null_ path with _zero path length_
	- Therefore, the _extremised proper time_ must be a _maximum_
- One can then _extremise_ the proper time:
$$\tau=\int\left|g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\right|^{1/2}\,du$$
- Add some _variation_ $\delta\tau$, with $f=g_{\mu\nu}(dx^\mu/du)(dx^\nu/du)$:
$$\delta\tau=\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}\delta f\,du$$
- Specify $\tau$ as the _parameter_ of the variation, such that the _tangent vector_ is the [[Special Relativity#Particle kinetics in index notation|4-velocity]] $U^\mu$, and $f=1$
- For _stationary proper time_, one must _extremise_ the integral:
$$I=\frac{1}{2}\int f\,d\tau$$
- By adding some _variation_ in $\delta x^\mu$, and _integrating by parts_, one recovers the _geodesic equation_ as:
$$\displaylines{x^\mu\to x^\mu+\delta x^\mu \\ g_{\mu\nu}\to g_{\mu\nu}+(\partial_\sigma g_{\mu\nu})\delta x^\sigma \\ \frac{d^2x^\mu}{d\tau^2}+\Gamma^\mu_{\rho\sigma}\frac{dx^\rho}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\sigma}{d\tau}=0}$$
- One can also use this method to _obtain the Christoffel symbols_ by extremising the path

- In the derivation above, $f$ is the _Lagrangian_ of the variation:
$$\Lagr=g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau}$$

### Alternate form of geodesic equation
- By writing out the _Euler-Lagrange equation_ explicitly, and _lowering indices_, one can get an _alternative form_ of the geodesic equation:
$$\frac{d^2x_\mu}{d\tau^2}=\frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu g_{\nu\lambda}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\lambda}{d\tau}$$
### Affine parameters
- Therefore, the geodesic equation can be _parametrised by proper time_
- In fact, it can be parametrised with _any parameter_ $\lambda$ that _satisfies_:
$$\tau\to\lambda=a\tau+b$$
- $\lambda$ is then known as an _affine parameter_

- For a _timelike path_, the geodesic equation in terms of the _4-velocity_ and _4-momentum_:
$$U^\lambda\nabla_\lambda U^\mu=0 \hspace{1.5cm} p^\lambda\nabla_\lambda p^\mu=0$$

- For a _null path_, $\tau$ is _not a proper affine parameter_
	- If it is a geodesic for _some parameter_ $\lambda$, then $a\lambda+b$ is also an affine parameter
- For a null path, one _normalises_ $\lambda$ such that:
$$p^{\mu}=\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}$$


### Particle kinetics and conserved quantities on a geodesic
- A _freely-falling_ test particle (which _does not influence the geometry through which it moves_), will always _move along a geodesic_
- It always _moves along the direction in which the 4-momentum is pointing_
	- Reflected in $p^\lambda\nabla_\lambda p^\mu=0$

- A geodesic is also a path of _maximum proper time_
	- It has _maximum proper time locally_
	- Example: in the _twin paradox_, the stationary twin is _on a geodesic_

- _Given_ some vector at a point, then _solving for subsequent motion on a geodesic_, one generates a _unique geodesic_, which is _everywhere timelike/null/spacelike_
	- Parallel transport _preserves_ the interval

- The _conservation_ of the interval follows from the fact that the _Lagrangian_ is _not explicitly dependent_ on the affine parameter

- One can also see that if:
$$\partial_\mu g_{\nu\lambda}=0\Longrightarrow \frac{dx_\mu}{d\tau}=\text{const.}$$
- If the metric is _independent of some coordinate direction_ $x^\mu$, the $x^\mu$ component of the _tangent vector_ must be _conserved_
- It is effectively the _conjugate momentum_

# Curvature
- One characterises curvature using the _Riemann curvature tensor_
- On a _flat space_:
	- Parallel transport round a _loop_ leaves a vector _unchanged_
	- _Covariant derivatives_ will _commute_
	- Geodesics that are _initially parallel_ will _remain parallel_

## The Riemann curvature tensor
- On a curved space, the _change_ in a vector around a closed loop is related to _total curvature enclosed_
- Then for _local curvature_, let there be an _infinitesimal loop_
- This is an _intrinsic property_ of the surface, and has _nothing to do with embedding_

- For vector $V^\rho$, around a loop with vectors $A^\mu$ and $B^\nu$, the _change in the vector_ should be _proportional_ to components $V^\sigma$, as well as $A^\mu$ and $B^\nu$
- Therefore, define the _Riemann curvature tensor_:
$$\delta V^\rho=\tenscom{R}{\rho}{\sigma\mu\nu}V^\sigma A^\mu B^\nu$$
- _Swapping_ the vectors results in a loop in the opposite direction, hence:
$$\tenscom{R}{\rho}{\sigma\mu\nu}=-\tenscom{R}{\rho}{\sigma\nu\mu}$$
- For an infinitesimal loop, take the _commutator_ of two _covariant derivatives_:
$$[\nabla_\mu,\nabla_\nu]V^\rho=\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu V^\rho-\nabla_\nu\nabla_\mu V^\rho$$
- Expanding out all of the terms:
$$[\nabla_\mu,\nabla_\nu]V^\rho=(\partial_\mu\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma}-\nabla_\nu\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\sigma}+\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\sigma}-\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\sigma})V^\sigma-\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}\nabla_\lambda V^\rho$$
- Here, $\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}$ is the _torsion tensor_, equal to $2\Gamma^\lambda_{[\mu\nu]}$
- This is true for _any connection_

- So, one can identify the _Riemann curvature tensor_:
$$\tenscom{R}{\rho}{\mu\nu\sigma}\equiv-\partial_\nu\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\sigma}+\partial_\sigma\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\nu}+\Gamma^\rho_{\sigma\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\mu}-\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\sigma}$$
- From this, the action of the commutator can be calculated for a _tensor of any rank_:
$$\begin{aligned}\left[\nabla_\sigma, \nabla_\rho\right]\tenscom{X}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_k}=&+\tenscom{R}{\mu_1}{\sigma\rho\lambda}\tenscom{X}{\lambda\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}+\tenscom{R}{\mu_2}{\sigma\rho\lambda}\tenscom{X}{\mu_1\lambda\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}+\dots \\ &-\tenscom{R}{\lambda}{\sigma\rho\nu_1}\tenscom{X}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\lambda\nu_2\dots\nu_l}-\tenscom{R}{\lambda}{\sigma\rho\nu_2}\tenscom{X}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\lambda\dots\nu_l}-\dots  \\ &-\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\sigma\rho}\tenscom{X}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}\end{aligned}$$

### Interpreting curvature
- As the curvature tensor is for _any connection_, intepret it as the [[#The metric connection|metric connection]]
- The connection, as well as the _curvature_, are _derived from the metric itself_

- Consider a _simple-connected region_ of a manifold
- If a coordinate system exists such that the _components of the metric are constant_, then the Riemann curvature tensor will _always vanish_
	- The _converse_ is true (if the Riemann tensor _vanishes_, one can _always construct_ a coordinate system where the _components of the metric are constant_)

- For the components of the metric to be _constant everywhere_:
	- The [[#The strong equivalence principle|equivalence principle]] requires that spacetime is _always locally Minkowski_
$$g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}\hspace{1.5cm} \partial_\lambda g_{\mu\nu}=0$$
- From this, the _metric connection is always zero_, and hence there is _zero curvature_

- _Locally_, in an infinitesimal area, one can always make [[#Local Cartesian Coordinates on Riemannian manifolds|local Cartesian coordinates]]
	- In accordance with the equivalence principle
	- _Freedom_ to fix components and first derivative of metric tensor
- However, the _second derivative of the metric_ cannot be made to vanish locally
- This gives rise to _curvature_

### Fermi-normal coordinates
- One can construct coordinates along a _time-like geodesic_ such that 
$$g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}\hspace{1.5cm} \partial_\lambda g_{\mu\nu}=0$$
- Only _along the geodesic_

- These are known as _Fermi-normal coordinates_, extending the idea of _locally_ Cartesian coordinates

### Newtonian limit for free-falling
- In the _absence_ of gravity, spacetime is _Minkowski_
- For _weak field_, the metric is _close to Minkowski_ (locally curved)
$$g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu}\hspace{1cm}|h_{\mu\nu}|\ll1$$
- Assume the gravitational field is _static_, hence $\partial h_{\mu\nu}/\partial x^0=0$
- The particle is _slow-moving_ $(v\ll c)$, hence:
$$|u^i|\ll u^0$$

- In the [[#Geodesics, proper time, and affine parameters|geodesic equation]], ignore all $u^i$ terms relative to $u^0$:
$$\frac{d^2x^\mu}{d\tau^2}+\Gamma^\mu_{00}\left(\frac{dx^0}{d\tau}\right)^2\approx 0$$
- The relevant _connection coefficients_, to the _first order_:
$$\displaylines{\Gamma^\mu_{00}=-\frac{1}{2}\eta^{\mu i}\pd{h_{00}}{x^i} \\ \Gamma^0_{00}=0\hspace{1.5cm}\Gamma^i_{00}=\frac{1}{2}\pd{h_{00}}{x_i}}$$
- This gives:
$$\frac{dx^0}{d\tau}=\text{const.}\hspace{1.5cm}\frac{d^2x^i}{d\tau^2}=-\frac{1}{2}\pd{h_{00}}{x_i}\left(\frac{dx^0}{d\tau}\right)^2$$
- This gives the _Newtonian equation of motion_:
$$\displaylines{\frac{d^2x^i}{dt^2}=-\pd{\Phi}{x_i} \\ g_{00}=\left(1+\frac{2\Phi}{c^2}\right)}$$
- This gives a _small perturbation_ to the metric provided $\Phi/c^2\ll1$

## Properties of the Riemann curvature tensor
- Examine the curvature tensor with _all lower indices_:
$$R_{\rho\sigma\mu\nu}=g_{\rho\lambda}\tenscom{R}{\lambda}{\sigma\mu\nu}$$

- Using [[#Locally inertial coordinates]], one can prove its symmetry properties
	- Use _local inertial coordinates_, where the _metric connection vanishes, but its derivative does not_

- It is _antisymmetric in its first and second pairs of indices_
$$R_{\rho\sigma\mu\nu}=-R_{\sigma\rho\mu\nu}=-R_{\rho\sigma\nu\mu}$$
- _Swapping_ the first pair of indices with the second is also _symmetric_:
$$R_{\rho\sigma\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$$

- The _sum of cyclic permutations of the last 3 indices_ vanishes:
$$\displaylines{R_{\rho\sigma\mu\nu}+R_{\rho\nu\sigma\mu}+R_{\rho\mu\nu\sigma}=0 \\ R_{\rho[\sigma\mu\nu]}=0}$$

- This then gives that the _total antisymmetric part_ of the tensor vanishes:
$$R_{[\rho\sigma\mu\nu]}=0$$

- One can then find that in $n$ dimensions, the _number of independent components_:
$$\frac{n^2}{12}(n^2-1)$$

- For the metric connection, it also obeys the _Bianchi identity_:
$$\nabla_{[\lambda}R_{\rho\sigma]\mu\nu}=0$$
## Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, and the Einstein tensor
- _Contractions_ of the Riemann tensor can be useful

### Ricci tensor and scalar
- Take a _contraction_ in the _upper index, and the second lower index_ to form the _Ricci tensor_:
$$R_{\mu\nu}=\tenscom{R}{\lambda}{\mu\lambda\nu}$$
- For the _metric connection_, this is the _only independent contraction_
- For this connection, it is also _symmetric_:
$$R_{\mu\nu}=R_{\nu\mu}$$

- The _contraction_ of the Ricci tensor is the _Ricci scalar_:
$$R=\tenscom{R}{\mu}{\mu}=g^{\mu\nu}R_{\mu\nu}$$


### Contracted Bianchi identity and Einstein tensor
- _Contract_ the Bianchi identity _twice_:
$$\begin{aligned}0&=g^{\nu\sigma}g^{\mu\lambda}(\nabla_\lambda R_{\rho\sigma\mu\nu}+\nabla_\rho R_{\sigma\lambda\mu\nu}+\nabla_\sigma R_{\lambda\rho\mu\nu}) \\ &=\nabla^\mu R_{\rho\mu}-\nabla_\rho R+\nabla^\nu R_{\rho\nu}\end{aligned}$$
- Due to [[#The metric connection|metric compatibility]], the _indices on covariant derivatives_ can be _raised_

- Define the _Einstein tensor_:
$$G_{\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}$$
- Then the twice-contracted Bianchi identity leads to:
$$\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}=0$$
- The Einstein tensor is _symmetric_, and _divergence-free_
### Interpretation
- The _curvature tensor_ contains _all required information_ for the curvature of the manifold
- The _Ricci tensor/scalar_ could _vanish even if_ the curvature tensor is non-zero

- The curvature tensor is an _intrinsic property_ of the manifold
	- Example: a _1D manifold cannot_ be curved (e.g. circle)
	- A _torus_ has no intrinsic curvature (a rolled-up square)

- For a _2D manifold_ (e.g. 2-sphere), there is _1 independent component_, hence the _Ricci scalar_ contains the _full information_ about curvature

## Symmetries and Killing vectors (non-examinable)
- Situations with _symmetry_ are simpler to deal with
	- Easier to find solutions to [[#Einstein's equation]]
	- Example: region outside a star is _spherically symmetric_

### Symmetry and isometries
- A manifold $M$ possesses a symmetry if the _geometry is invariant under a transformation, which maps $M$ to itself_ 
	- Or, in other words, the _metric_ is the _same from one point to another_ determined by the transformation
- Symmetries of the _metric_ are known as _isometries_

- Example: Minkowski space
$$ds^2=dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2$$
- The metric is _invariant under any translations $x^\mu\to x^\mu+a^\mu$
- It is also invariant under _Lorentz transformations_ $x^\mu\to \tenscom{\Lambda}{\mu}{\nu}x^\nu$

- This is made obvious by the fact that _all components are coordinate-independent_ (taking $x^{\sigma*}$ as some direction):
$$\partial_{\sigma*}g_{\mu\nu}=0$$
- _If_ this is satisfied, then _translations along_ $x_{\sigma*}$ are _symmetries_

- Independence of metric components _implies existence of an isometry_, but the _converse is not true_
	- In 4-dimensions, there are _4 translations_ and _6 Lorentz transformations_, exceeding the total number of independent metric components

### Conservation along geodesics
- The [[#Geodesics, proper time, and affine parameters|geodesic equation]] in terms of 4-momentum, and using [[#The metric connection|metric compatibility]]:
$$p^\lambda\nabla_\lambda p^\mu=0 \Longrightarrow p^\lambda\nabla_\lambda p_\mu=0$$
- _Expanding_ the covariant derivative and writing out the _metric connection_ using symmetry between indices $\lambda$ and $\nu$:
$$m\frac{dp_\mu}{d\tau}=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu g_{\lambda\nu})p^\lambda p^\nu$$
- Therefore, if _all metric coefficients are independent of coordinate_ $x^{\sigma*}$:
$$\partial_{\sigma*}g_{\mu\nu}=0\Longrightarrow \frac{dp_{\sigma*}}{d\tau}=0$$
- The _momentum along $x_{\sigma*}$_ is _conserved_
- This holds along _any timelike geodesic_

### Killing vectors and tensors, Killing's equation
- If metric components are _independent of_ $x^{\sigma*}$, label the _vector_ $K$:
$$\displaylines{K=\partial_{\sigma*} \\ K^\mu=(\partial_{\sigma*})^\mu=\delta^\mu_{\sigma*}\\ p_{\sigma*}=K^\nu p_\nu=K_\nu p^\nu}$$
- It is said that $K$ _generates_ the isometry
	- The _transformation_ under which geometry is invariant is expressed as an _infinitesimal motion along_ $K$

- Conservation _along the geodesic_ implies:
$$\frac{dp_{\sigma*}}{d\tau}=0\Longrightarrow p^\mu\nabla_\mu(K_\nu p^\nu)=0$$
- Manifestation of [[Analytical classical mechanics#Symmetries and Noether's Theorem|Noether's Theorem]]

- Expanding the equation above and using the [[#Conservation along geodesics|geodesic equation]]:
$$p^\mu \nabla_\mu(K_\nu p^\nu)=p^\mu p^\nu(\nabla_\mu K_{\nu})=p^\mu p^\nu \nabla_{(\mu}K_{\nu)}=0$$

- The last equality is _Killing's equation_, and $K$ is a _Killing vector_
- _Any vector_ satisfying Killing's equation _guarantees_ that $K_\nu p^\nu$ is _conserved along a geodesic_:
$$\nabla_{(\mu}K_{\nu)}=0\Longrightarrow p^\mu \nabla_\mu(K_\nu p^\nu)=0$$

- It is _not strictly necessary_ for $K$ to be in the form of $\partial_{\sigma*}$
- If a vector $K^\mu$ satisfies Killing's equation, one can _always find a coordinate system where_ $K=\partial_{\sigma*}$
- In general, one _cannot_ find coordinates where _all Killing vectors_ are in that form

- Killing's equation _generalises_ into tensors:
$$\nabla_{(\mu}K_{\nu_1\dots\nu_l)}=0\Longrightarrow p^\mu\nabla_\mu(K_{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}p^{\nu_1}\dots p^{\nu_l})=0$$
- An example of the Killing tensor is _the metric itself_, and _symmetrised tensor products of Killing vectors_

- In $n\geq2$ dimensions, there can be _more Killing vectors than dimensions_
- One can construct _linear combinations of Killing vectors with constant coefficients_ to make more Killing vectors
- The _commutator_ of Killing vectors is also a Killing vector field
### Interpretation
- Killing vector fields _correspond to continuous symmetries of the metric on the manifold_
- Every Killing vector _implies the existence of conserved quantities along a geodesic_
	- As the metric is _unchanged_ in that direction, the _geometry_ is unchanged and a _free particle feels no forces_ in that direction, hence _momentum is conserved_

### Relation to curvature
- The _derivatives_ of the Killing vector is related to the Riemann tensor by:
$$\displaylines{\nabla_\mu \nabla_\sigma K^\rho=\tenscom{R}{\rho}{\sigma\mu\nu}K^\nu \\ \nabla_\mu\nabla_\sigma K^\mu=R_{\sigma\nu}K^\nu \\ K^\lambda\nabla_\lambda R=0}$$
- The last expression is proven using _Bianchi's identity_, Killing's equation and the second equation
- It reflects that _geometry does not change along a Killing vector_
### Conserved energy
- With Killing vectors, one can establish a _conserved energy_
- Construct a _current_ with the _energy-momentum tensor_:
$$J^\mu_T=K_\nu T^{\mu\nu}$$
- From _Killing's equation_ and the _vanishing divergence_ of $T^{\mu\nu}$, the current is _automatically conserved_:
$$\nabla_\mu J^\mu_T=0$$

- If $K_\nu$ is timelike, one can [[#Lengths and volumes|integrate]] _over a spacelike hypersurface_ $\Sigma$ to define total energy:
$$E_T=\int_\Sigma J_T^\mu n_\mu\sqrt{\gamma}\,d^3x$$
- Here, $\gamma_{ij}$ is the _induced metric_ on the hypersurface and $n_\mu$ is the _normal vector_ to $\Sigma$

- $E_T$ is the _same when integrated over any spacelike surface_, and is _conserved_

- For any _time-like Killing vector_, one can write the metric in a form _independent of the timelike coordinate_, and [[Analytical classical mechanics#Symmetries and Noether's Theorem|Noether's Theorem]] implies a _conserved energy_
### Examples of Killing vectors
- Consider the metric in $\mathbb{R}^3$:
$$ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+dz^2$$
- There are _three Killing vectors_
$$X^\mu=(1,0,0)\hspace{1cm}Y^\mu=(0,1,0)\hspace{1cm}Z=(0,0,1)$$
- For _rotational symmetries_, one can get a _vector field for each axis_
	- $R=\partial_\phi$, representing a $z-$rotation, hence $R=-y\partial_x+x\partial_y$
$$R^\mu=(-y,x,0)\hspace{1cm}S^\mu=(z,0,x)\hspace{1cm}T^\mu=(0,-z,y)$$

- For the _2-sphere_ $S^2$:
$$ds^2=d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta\,d\phi^2$$
- The rotational symmetries in $\mathbb{R}^3$, with $r=1$ _represents symmetries on_ $S^2$
- Transforming to spherical coordinates:
$$\begin{aligned}R&=\partial_\phi \\ S&=\cos\phi\,\partial_\theta-\cot\theta\sin\phi\,\partial_\phi \\ T&=-\sin\phi\,\partial_\theta-\cot\theta\cos\phi\,\partial_\phi\end{aligned}$$

## Maximally symmetric spaces
- There can be spaces with the _highest possible degree of symmetry_

- Consider the $n-$dimensional _Euclidean flat space_ $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
- The [[#Symmetry|isometries]] are:
	- $n(n-1)/2$ _rotations_ ($n$ axes can rotate into $n-1$ axes)
	- $n$ _translations_
- This gives $n(n+1)/2$ linearly independent [[#Killing vectors and tensors, Killing's equation|Killing vectors]]

- Any $n-$dimensional manifold with $n(n+1)/2$ Killing vectors are known as _maximally symmetric spaces_
	- Examples: $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $S^{n}$ ($n-$dimensional _spheres_)

- If a space is _maximally symmetric_, the curvature is the _same everywhere_, ans the _same in every direction_
	- Due to translation and rotation isometries respectively

- Maximally symmetric spaces can be _classified_ by the _Ricci scalar_, the _dimensionality_, the _metric signature_, and the _global topology_

### Riemann tensor for a maximally symmetric space
- To construct a curvature tensor that is the _same everywhere in all directions_, choose [[#Locally inertial coordinates]]
- Like the metric for locally inertial coordinates, the _curvature tensor_ must also be constant under some _Lorentz transformation_
	- Any _change of basis_ that leaves the _metric_ $g_{\hat{\mu}\hat{\nu}}=\eta_{\hat{\mu}\hat{\nu}}$ _invariant_
- To match the [[#Properties of the Riemann curvature tensor|symmetries]] of the Riemann tensor:
$$R_{\hat{\rho}\hat{\sigma}\hat{\mu}\hat{\nu}}\propto g_{\hat{\rho}\hat{\mu}}g_{\hat{\sigma}\hat{\nu}}-g_{\hat{\rho}\hat{\nu}}g_{\hat{\sigma}\hat{\mu}}$$
- As this is a _tensorial relation_, it applies _generally_
- By _contracting_ both sides twice, one gets:
$$R_{\rho\sigma \mu \nu}=\frac{R}{n(n-1)}(g_{\rho \mu}g_{\sigma \nu}-g_{\rho \nu}g_{\sigma \mu})$$
- The _Bianchi identity_ demands that $R$ is _constant_

- In general, if the Riemann tensor _satisfies_ this relation, with $R$ as a _constant over the manifold_, the metric is _maximally symmetric_

## Geodesic deviation
- In _Euclidean geometry_, if two lines are _initially parallel_, they will _always be parallel_
- On a _curved space_, two _initially parallel geodesics_ will eventually _cross_

- Consider a _family of geodesics_ $\gamma_s(t)$, each parametrised by an _affine parameter_ $t$, and _labelled_ by $s\in \mathbb{R}$
- They then define a _smooth, two-dimensional surface_, with _coordinates_ $x^\mu(s,t)$ as long as the geodesics _do not cross_

- From their definition, _all geodesics_ must [[#Geodesics, proper time, and affine parameters|satisfy]]:
$$\frac{D}{Dt}\pd{x^\mu}{t}=0$$

- The _tangent vectors_ to each geodesic:
$$T^\mu=\pd{x^\mu}{t}$$
- One can also define a _deviation vector_:
$$S^\mu=\pd{x^\mu}{s}$$
![[Geodesic deviation.png]]

- Define a _relative velocity_ of geodesics:
$$V^\mu=\frac{D}{Dt}S^\mu=T^\rho\nabla_\rho S^\mu$$
- One then defines a _relative accleration_:
$$A^\mu=\frac{D}{Dt}V^\mu=T^\rho\nabla_\rho V^\mu$$

- As $S^\mu$ and $T^\mu$ are the _basis vectors_ for the surface:
$$[S,T]=0\Longrightarrow S^\rho\nabla_\rho T^\mu=T^\rho\nabla_\rho S^\mu$$

- By using definitions of the [[#The Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]] and [[#Geodesics, proper time, and affine parameters|geodesics]], one can derive:
$$A^\mu=\frac{D^2}{Dt^2}S^\mu=\tenscom{R}{\mu}{\nu\rho\sigma}T^\nu T^\rho S^\sigma$$

- The _relative acceleration_ is then _proportional to the curvature_

- This gives the _geodesic deviation_

### Tidal effects
- The geodesic deviation describes _relative acceleration of neighbouring free-falling particles_, due to _tidal effects_

- Consider free-falling particles along geodesics $\bar{x}^\mu(\tau)$ and $x^\mu(\tau)$
- The _connecting vector_ is then:
$$S^\mu(\tau)=\bar{x}^\mu(\tau)-x^\mu(\tau)$$
- One can derive the _tidal tensor_:
$$\displaylines{A^\mu=\tenscom{S}{\mu}{\sigma}S^\sigma \\ \tenscom{S}{\mu}{\sigma}=\tenscom{R}{\mu}{\nu\rho\sigma}T^\nu T^\rho=\tenscom{R}{\mu}{\nu\rho\sigma}u^\nu u^\rho}$$
- The _tangent vectors_ $T^\mu$ are the _4-velocities_ $u^\mu$

- The tidal tensor $S_{\mu\nu}$ is _symmetric_

- Given a _gravitational potential_ $\Phi$:
$$\frac{d^2x^i}{dt^2}=-\pd{\Phi}{x^i}\Bigg|_{x}\hspace{1.5cm}\frac{d^2x^i}{dt^2}=-\pd{\Phi}{\bar{x}^i}\Bigg|_{\bar{x}}$$

- Taking the _difference_, and _expanding in first order_:
$$\frac{d^2 S^i}{dt^2}=-\pd{^2\Phi}{x^i\partial x^j}S^j$$
- This give a form of the _tidal tensor_

# Gravitation
- In _Newtonian gravity_, acceleration depends on a _gravitational potential_ $\Phi$:
$$\bm{a}=-\grad\Phi$$
- The gravitational potential depends on _Poisson's equation_:
$$\nabla^2\Phi=4\pi G\rho$$

- Laws of physics in _flat spacetime_ can be converted to _tensorial_ form, and then are assumed to apply in _curved spacetime_
	- Arising from the [[#The strong equivalence principle|equivalence principle]]
- Example: a _free-falling_ particle follows the _geodesic equation_ with affine parameter $\tau$:
$$\frac{d^2x^\mu}{d\tau^2}=0$$
- A _slow_ free-falling particle gives the [[#Newtonian limit for free-falling]]

- Example: the [[Special Relativity#Conservation|conservation]] in the [[Special Relativity#Energy-momentum tensor|energy-momentum tensor]] still holds with the _covariant derivative_
$$\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0$$

## Einstein's equation
- Einstein's equation determines the evolution of the _metric_

- One can _generalise_ Poisson's equation to curved spacetime
- Generalise _mass density_ as the _energy-momentum tensor_
- Generalise the _potential_ as the _metric tensor_

- The _second derivative_ of the metric is contained in the [[#Curvature|curvature tensor]]
	- The _derivatives_ cannot be generalised into the d'Alembertian due to _metric compatibility_ making it zero
- One must also _preserve_ conservation of $T^{\mu\nu}$

- Write Einstein's equation in the form:
$$K_{\mu\nu}=-\kappa T_{\mu\nu}$$
- Here, $K^{\mu\nu}$ is some _symmetric_ type $(0,2)$ tensor following the _conservation_ law

- Setting $K$ as the [[#Ricci tensor and scalar|Ricci tensor]], and using the [[#Contracted Bianchi identity and Einstein tensor|Bianchi identity]] implies that $\nabla_\mu T=0$, and is unphysical

- From the Bianchi identity, identify $K$ as the [[#Contracted Bianchi identity and Einstein tensor|Einstein tensor]] instead:
$$G_{\mu\nu}=R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}=-\kappa T_{\mu\nu}$$
- Taking the _trace_ of both sides implies:
$$R=\kappa T$$
- Then consider _dust_ in the _Newtonian limit_ to obtain $\kappa$
	- Work in _first order_, such that $U^0=1$, $T=T_{00}=\rho$, and $R_{00}=\nabla^2 h_{00}/2$

- This gives _Einstein's equation_:
$$R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}=-8\pi GT_{\mu\nu}$$

- Taking the _trace_ $(R=8\pi GT)$ and rewriting the equation gives:
$$R_{\mu\nu}=-8\pi G\left(T_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Tg_{\mu\nu}\right)$$

- The coefficient can also be written as $8\pi G/c^{4}$

## Properties and interpretation of the Einstein equation
- It can be interpreted as a _differential equation_ for the _$N(N+1)/2$ independent components_ of $g_{\mu\nu}$
- The [[#Contracted Bianchi identity and Einstein tensor|Bianchi identity]] imposes $N$ constraints, hence there are _$N(N-1)/2$ independent equations_
	- Constraint is from the fact that solutions must apply to _all coordinate systems_

- In general, the equation states that the _energy-momentum tensor_ acts as a _source_ that generates _curvature_ in the metric, and hence a _gravitational field_
- With _positive energy density and pressure_, gravity is an _attractive_ force
	- Consider a _ball_ of free test particles along neighbouring timelike geodesics, and the _divergence_ of 4-velocities $\nabla_\mu U^\mu$
	- _Pressure_ can cause an attractive force _with no gradient_ as only the _local value_ matters

- The equation is also _non-linear_
- As $T_{\mu\nu}$ often involves the metric, gravity is said to _couple to itself_
	- Without the coupling, two particles _bound by gravity_ will have _different inertial and gravitational masses_ due to binding energy

- In _vacuum_, the equation reduces to:
$$R_{\mu\nu}=0$$
- This _does not necessarily mean spacetime is flat_ (See [[#The Schwarzchild solution]])

## Cosmological constant and vacuum energy
- In _non-gravitational fields_, only _changes_ in energy are _measurable_
- In gravity, energy must have a _definite value_ to generate the required _curvature_

- Then, for a _vacuum_, one may expect a _vacuum energy density_
- As it must be _Lorentz invariant_ and _isotropic_, for [[#Locally inertial coordinates]]
$$T_{\hat{\mu}\hat{\nu}}^\text{vac}=\rho_\text{vac}\eta_{\hat{\mu}\hat{\nu}}$$
- So for _arbitrary coordinates_:
$$T^{\text{vac}}_{\mu\nu}=\rho_\text{vac}g_{\mu\nu}$$
- Comparing this to the [[Special Relativity#Perfect fluid|perfect fluid]], this gives the _pressure_ as _negative_:
$$p_\text{vac}=-\rho_\text{vac}$$

- Decompose $T_{\mu\nu}$ into _contributions_ from _matter_ and _vacuum_:
$$R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}=-8\pi G(T_{\mu\nu}^\text{M}+\rho_\text{vac}g_{\mu\nu})$$

- This allows one to _rewrite_ Einstein's equation with a _cosmological constant_:
$$\displaylines{R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu\nu}=-8\pi GT_{\mu\nu}^\text{M} \\ \Lambda = 8\pi G\rho_\text{vac}}$$
- This equation _satisfies_ that the equation is _divergence-free_ and constructed from the _metric_
	- The _only other solution_ according to _Lovelock's Theorem_

- This allows for a _static cosmology_
- $\Lambda$ has the _observed value_:
$$\Lambda=1.1\times 10^{-52}\,\text{m}^{-2}$$

- In the _weak-field limit_, spacetime is _not locally flat_, and reproduces the force laws (for a _point mass_):
$$\displaylines{\nabla^2\Phi=4\pi G\rho-\Lambda c^2 \\ -\nabla\Phi=-\frac{GM}{r^3}\bm{x}+\frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}\bm{x}}$$
- It produces a _repulsion_

- The _vacuum energy_ can be explained as _zero-point energy of a harmonic oscillator_ in field theories
# The Schwarzchild solution
- The _non-linearity_ of the Einstein field equation makes it hard to find _exact solutions_
- For cases of _symmetry_, one can find certain simple exact solutions
- One is often interested in _exterior solutions_ (i.e. empty space _surrounding a body_) as it is easier to understand _test particles outside_ the object
	- Vacuum solution: $T^{\mu\nu}$ and $R^{\mu \nu}$ vanish

- For a _spherically symmetric_ gravitational field in _vacuum_, use _spherical coordinates_ $\{t,r,\theta,\phi\}$
- Let the _source_, and hence the gravitational field, be _static_
	- Metric components _do not depend on time_
	- There are _no time cross terms_ (time inversion $t\to -t$ does not affect metric)
- The _Schwarzchild metric_ is then:
$$ds^2=\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)dt^2-\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)^{-1}dr^2-r^2d\Omega^2$$
- Here, $d\Omega^2$ is the _metric on the unit two-sphere_:
$$d\Omega^2=d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2$$

- The metric is _singular_ at $r=0$ and $r=2GM$
	- At $r=0$, the scalar $R^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}R_{\mu \nu \rho\sigma}$ becomes _infinite_
	- $r=2GM$ describes the _event horizon_ of [[#Schwarzchild black holes]]
- Only _valid_ for $r>2GM$ as expected

- For $r\gg 2GM$, and expanding to the first order, this can reduce to the [[#Newtonian limit for free-falling]]
## Deriving the Schwarzchild metric
- In _Minkowski space_, the metric in spherical coordinates:
$$ds^2_\text{Minkowski}=dt^2-dr^2-r^2\,d\Omega^2$$
- To preserve _spherical symmetry_ and the _signature_ (signs of components) of the metric:
$$ds^2=\exp[2\alpha(r)]\,dt^2-\exp[2\beta(r)]\,dr^2-\exp{[2\gamma(r)]}r^2\,d\Omega^2$$
- One can then _define a new radial coordinate_:
$$\displaylines{\bar{r}=\exp[\gamma(r)]r \\ ds^2=\exp[2\alpha(r)]dt^2-\left(1+r\frac{d\gamma}{dr}\right)^{-2}\exp[2\gamma(r)-2\beta(r)]\,d\bar{r}^2-\bar{r}^2\,d\Omega^2}$$
- Then _relabelling_ $\bar{r}\to r$ and the coefficient of $d\bar{r}^2$ as $\exp[2\beta(r)]$:
$$ds^2=\exp[2\alpha(r)]dt^2-\exp[2\beta(r)]dr^2-r^2\,d\Omega^2$$
- This is _still a general result_ as coordinates were simply _relabelled_

- Then calculating the _Christoffel symbols_ as well as the _Ricci tensor_, one finds that _off-diagonal components vanish_:
$$\begin{aligned}R_{tt}&=\exp[2(\alpha-\beta)]\left[-\alpha
''+(\alpha')^2+\alpha'\beta'-\frac{2}{r}\alpha'\right] \\ R_{rr}&=\alpha''-(\alpha')^2-\alpha'\beta'-\frac{2}{r}\beta' \\ R_{\theta\theta}&=\exp[-2\beta][r(\alpha'-\beta')+1]-1 \\ R_{\phi\phi}&=\sin^2\theta \,R_{\theta\theta}\end{aligned}$$

- As $R_{tt}$ and $R_{rr}$ vanish _independently_:
$$0=\exp[2(\beta-\alpha)]R_{tt}+R_{rr}=-\frac{2}{r}(\alpha'+\beta')=0$$
- This implies $\alpha=-\beta+c$, where $c$ is a constant, and by rescaling $t\to \exp(-c)t$:
$$\alpha=-\beta$$
- Then by solving $R_{\theta\theta}=0$:
$$\exp(2\alpha)=1-\frac{R_S}{r}$$
- Here, $R_S$ is an _undetermined constant_, known as the _Schwarzchild radius_

- Comparing with the [[#Newtonian limit for free-falling|Newtonian limit]]:
$$\displaylines{R_S=2GM \\ ds^2=\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)dt^2-\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)^{-1}dr^2-r^2d\Omega^2}$$

- One can think of it as the _definition_ of $M$ as a _single Newtonian mass_
- In the $M\to0$ and $r\to\infty$ limits, one recovers the _Minkowski metric_
	- Known as _asymptotic flatness_

### Birkhoff's Theorem
- _Birkhoff's Theorem_ states that the Schwarzchild metric is _the unique vacuum solution for spherical symmetry_
- There also _no time-independent solutions of this form_

- Hence, _any spherically symmetric vacuum solutions_ must always be _static_ and _asymptotically flat_

## Geodesics and conservation
- The four geodesic equations are _coupled_

- There is a _high degree of symmetry_ for the Schwarzchild metric
- There must be four [[#Symmetries and Killing vectors (non-examinable)|Killing vectors]]
	- 3 for _rotations_, 1 for _time translations_
	- They are also _present in flat spacetime_

- If $K^\mu$ is a Killing vector, then _along the geodesic_, when $\lambda$ is an affine parameter:
$$K_\mu\frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}=\text{const.}$$
- And from the _geodesic equation_, one gets that for a timelike geodesic, the _norm of the tangent vector_ is always _conserved_:
$$\epsilon=g_{\mu \nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\lambda}$$
- Here, $\lambda$ is any [[#Affine parameters|affine parameter]]
	- For _timelike_ geodesics, it is $\tau$, and $\epsilon=+1$
	- For _null_ geodesics, it is chosen such that $p^{\mu}=dx^{\mu}/d\lambda$
- Also corresponds to the _normalisation_ of 4-velocity

- _Two_ of the _rotation_ Killing vectors can be used to _fix_ the _direction_ of conserved angular momentum, and _orient_ the coordinate system such that the particle is _moving in the equatorial plane_:
$$\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$$
- The _timelike_ Killing vector which fixes _energy_ is:
$$
K^{\mu}=\left(\partial_{t} \right)^{\mu}=(1,0,0,0)$$
- The Killing vector conserving the _magnitude of angular momentum_ is:
$$R^{\mu}=(\partial_{\phi })^{\mu}=(0,0,0,1)$$
- _Lowering_ the indices:
$$K_{\mu}=\left( \left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right),0,0,0 \right)\hspace{1.5cm}R_{\mu}=(0,0,0,-r^{2}\sin^{2}\theta)$$
- From this, with $\theta=\pi/2$ the _conserved quantities_ are:
$$\displaylines{E=K_{\mu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)\frac{dt}{d\lambda} \\ L=-R_{\mu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}=r^{2}\frac{d\phi}{d\lambda}}$$
- For _massless_ particles, they are _conserved energy and angular momentum_
- For _massive_ particles, they are _conserved energy and angular momentum per unit mass_
	- It is _not the same_ as $p_\mu U^\mu$ ([[Special Relativity#The 3+1 split|here]]) as that gives _kinetic_ energy, and the above gives the _conserved_ energy
	- $U^\mu$ is _normalised_ in a way that _does not solve_ Killing's equation

## Orbits as geodesics
- From the _conservation_ of $\epsilon$ above:
$$\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)\left( \frac{dt}{d\lambda} \right)^{2}-\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)^{-1}\left( \frac{dr}{d\lambda}\right)^{2}-r^{2}\left( \frac{d\phi}{d\lambda} \right)^{2}=\epsilon$$
- One can _rewrite_ this as:
$$\displaylines{\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{dr}{d\lambda} \right)^{2}+V(r)=\mathcal{E} \\ \mathcal{E}=\frac{1}{2}E^{2} \\ V(r)=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}-\varepsilon \frac{GM}{r}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}-\frac{GML^{2}}{r^{3}}}$$
- This is a version of _energy conservation_, where $V(r)$ is an _effective potential_
	- First term is a _constant_, second term is the _gravitational_ potential, third is from conservation of $L$
	- Last term is a _relativistic correction_
- In general, the particle will _move outward_ until the _turning point_ where $V(r)=\mathcal{E}$

### Newtonian case
- For _Newtonian massive particles_, there are _elliptical_ orbits as long as the particle's energy is _bound_ in the _potential well_
- [[Orbits|General Newtonian orbits]]
- There are _circular_ orbits when:
$$r_{c}=\frac{L^{2}}{\epsilon GM}$$
- Hence for _massless_ particles, there are _no circular orbits_
	- They move in a _straight line_, and $dr/d\lambda$ will _decrease_ near the object

![[Newtonian orbit V.png]]

### General relativistic case
- In _general relativity_, the _effective potential_ has an _extra term_
- It becomes significant at _small_ $r$, such that for $r\to0$, $V(r)$ goes to $-\infty$
- At $r=2GM$, the potential is _always zero_
	- Inside is the _black hole_

![[GR orbit V.png]]

#### Massless particle
- For a _massless_ particle, $\epsilon=0$ and one _always has an unstable circular orbit_ at:
$$r_{c}=3GM$$
- For example, a _photon_ can orbit at $3GM$ until some _perturbation_ sends it towards either $r\to0$ or $r\to\infty$
- If a photon moving _towards_ the body has a _high enough energy_, it will _spiral inwards_
- If the energy is too low, it will _escape back to infinity_

- Only the _ratio_ $L/E$ matters, as only the _direction_ in which the photon points matters
- The gravitational effect is _achromatic_
	- One can simply _rescale_ the affine parameter
- The ratio can be interpreted as the _impact parameter_ $b$
	- One can find $dr/d\phi$ from the conservation, then compare with the _straight-line path_ $r\sin\phi=b$ for large $r$

#### Massive particle
- For _massive_ particles, the circular orbits are at:
$$r_{c}=\frac{L^{2}\pm \sqrt{ L^{4}-12G^{2}M^{2}L^{2} }}{2GM}$$
- For _large_ $L$, there are two circular orbits, one _stable_ and one _unstable_:
$$r_{\text{stable}}=\frac{L^{2}}{GM}\hspace{1.5cm}r_{\text{unstable}}=3GM$$

- As $L$ decreases, the orbits _coincide_ at:
$$L=\sqrt{ 12 }GM\Longrightarrow r_{c}=6GM$$
- Hence, $6GM$ is the _smallest possible radius_ of a _stable circular orbit_ for this metric

- Like the massless case, a particle with _sufficient energy_ can spiral into $r=0$, once it surpasses the _barrier_ at $r=3GM$
	- This is only for _geodesics_, as a particle can _accelerate out_ as long as it does not reach $r=2GM$
- For _circular orbits_, $3GM<r<6GM$ is _unstable_ while $r>6GM$ is _stable_

- Like the Newtonian case, there are _unbound_ orbits
- There are also _stable, circular_ orbits, but they are _not closed_
	- They often _precess_

- This behaviour leads to the phenomena of _accretion disks_
- A particle moving in from large $r$ moves _inwards_, where it must _radiate energy_ to maintain a _bound orbit_

# Experimental tests for Schwarzchild
- Conserved quantities in the Schwarzchild solution:
$$\displaylines{E=K_{\mu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)\frac{dt}{d\lambda} \\ L=-R_{\mu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}=r^{2}\frac{d\phi}{d\lambda}}$$
- Equation for orbits, from conservation of $\epsilon$, norm of tangent vector:
$$\displaylines{\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{dr}{d\lambda} \right)^{2}+V(r)=\mathcal{E} \\ \mathcal{E}=\frac{1}{2}E^{2} \hspace{1.5cm} V(r)=\frac{\varepsilon}{2}-\varepsilon \frac{GM}{r}+\frac{L^{2}}{2r^{2}}-\frac{GML^{2}}{r^{3}}}$$

## Precession of orbits

### Shape equation
- For a _massive_ particle, by multiplying the equation above by $(d\phi/d\lambda)^2=r^2/L^2$, one gets an equation for the _orbit_:
$$\left( \frac{dr}{d\phi} \right)^{2}+\frac{1}{L^{2}}r^{4}-\frac{2GM}{L^{2}}r^{3}+r^{2}-2GMr=\frac{2\mathcal{E}}{L^{2}}r^{4}$$

- Defining the variable:
$$x=\frac{L^{2}}{GMr}$$
- For a _Newtonian circular orbit_, $x=1$
- The equation of motion becomes:
$$\left( \frac{dx}{d\phi} \right)^{2}+\frac{L^{2}}{G^{2}M^{2}}-2x+x^{2}-\frac{2G^{2}M^{2}}{L^{2}}x^{3}=\frac{2\mathcal{E}L^{2}}{G^{2}M^{2}}$$
- Then, _differentiating_ w.r.t. $\phi$ gives:
$$\frac{d^{2}x}{d\phi^{2}}-1+x=\frac{3G^{2}M^{2}}{L^{2}}x^{2}$$
- This is the _shape equation_

- For a _Newtonian_ orbit, the last term is _absent_, and the solution is:
$$x_{0}=1+e\cos \phi$$
- It is a _perfect ellipse_ with _eccentricity_ $e$

### Perturbation in orbit
- Expand $x$ into a _Newtonian solution_ $x_0$ and a _perturbation_ $x_1$:
$$\frac{d^{2}x_{0}}{d\phi^{2}}-1+x_{0}=0\hspace{1.5cm}\frac{d^{2}x_{1}}{d\phi^{2}}+x_{1}=\frac{3G^{2}M^{2}}{L^{2}}x_{0}^{2}$$
- Substituting the Newtonian solution into the equation for $x_1$:
$$x_{1}=\frac{3G^{2}M^{2}}{L^{2}}\left[ \left( 1+\frac{1}{2}e^{2} \right)+e\phi \sin \phi-\frac{1}{6}e^{2}\cos 2\phi \right]$$
- The first and third terms are _small deviations_ that are _constant_ or _average to zero_
- The second term can _build up_

- Therefore, one writes the solution:
$$x=1+e\cos \phi+\frac{3G^{2}M^{2}e}{L^{2}}\phi \sin \phi$$
- By writing the constant $\alpha=3G^{2}M^{2}/L^{2}$, the solution becomes:
$$x=1+e\cos[(1-\alpha)\phi]$$

- From this, in _each orbit_, one finds that the _perihelion_ shifts by angle:
$$\Delta \phi=2\pi\alpha=\frac{6\pi G^{2}M^{2}}{L^{2}}$$
![[Precessing ellipse.png]]
- For a [[Orbits#A summary|Newtonian orbit]] with _semi-major axis_ $a$:
$$L^{2}=GM(1-e^{2})a$$
- Therefore, in terms of Newtonian orbit parameters, one can write:
$$\Delta \phi=\frac{6\pi GM}{c^{2}(1-e^{2})a}$$
- For _Mercury_, this is $0.103$ arcseconds per orbit, or $43$ arcseconds per century
## Gravitational deflection of light
- Using a similar procedure to the above derivation, one gets:
$$\frac{d^{2}x}{d\phi^{2}}+x=\frac{3G^{2}M^{2}}{L^{2}}x^{2}$$
- The _Newtonian_ solution, corresponding to a _straight line_, gives:
$$L=b\hspace{1cm}r=\frac{b}{\sin \phi}\hspace{1cm}x=\frac{b}{GM}\sin \phi$$
- Here, $b$ is the _impact parameter_
![[Gravitational deflection.png]]

- Again, with some perturbation $x_1$, which goes to _zero_ as $\phi\to\pi$:
$$\displaylines{\frac{d^{2}x_{1}}{d\phi^{2}}+x_{1}=\frac{3G^{2}M^{2}}{L^{2}}x_{0}^{2} \\ x_{1}=\frac{3}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\cos 2\phi+2\cos \phi}$$
- Requiring that $x\to 0$ as $\phi \to-\Delta \phi$, where $|\Delta \phi|\ll 1$:
$$\Delta \phi \approx \frac{4GM}{c^{2}b}$$

## Gravitational redshift
- It is _independent_ from the [[Special Relativity#The Doppler Effect|effect of a moving observer]]
- Hence consider a _stationary observer_ $U^i=0$
- From the normalised 4-velocity, using the metric:
$$U^{0}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)^{-1/2}$$
- From the [[Special Relativity#The 3+1 split|formula for energy relative to some observer]]:
$$h\nu=g_{\mu \nu}U^{\mu}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\lambda}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)^{1/2}\frac{dt}{d\lambda}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)^{-1/2}E$$
- Therefore, comparing observed frequencies at two radii:
$$\frac{\nu_{2}}{\nu_{1}}=\left( \frac{1-2GM/r_{1}}{1-2GM/r_{2}} \right)^{1/2}$$
- The _red-shift_ is the ratio of _received to emitted wavelengths_ (reciprocal to frequency):
$$1+z=\left( \frac{\nu_{R}}{\nu_{E}} \right)^{{-1}}$$
- For photons _observed at infinity_ $r_{2}\to\infty$:
$$1+z_{\infty}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r_{1}} \right)^{-1/2}$$
- It _tends to infinity_ (it is _infinitely stretched out_) as $r_1\to2GM$

- This can _generalise to any time-independent metric_
	- The Killing vector for energy still leads to a conservation
- The formula is generalised to:
$$\frac{\nu_{R}}{\nu_{E}}=\sqrt{ \frac{g_{00}(E)}{g_{00}(R)} }$$

# Schwarzchild black holes
- The Schwarzchild metric shows _singular behaciour_ at $r=0$ and $r=2GM$
- The presence of singularities could be _coordinate-dependent_

- From Einstein's equation, $R_{\mu \nu}=0$ and hence the Ricci scalar $R=0$
- One can calculate another _coordinate-independent scalar_:
$$R^{\mu \nu \rho\sigma}R_{\mu \nu \rho\sigma}=\frac{48G^{2}M^{2}}{r^{6}}$$
- It is _singular_ at $r=0$

- It is _regular_ at $r=2GM$, hence it is a _coordinate-dependent singularity_, and one can construct a _new coordinate system_ 

## Inside the Schwarzchild radius
- For $0<r<2GM$, the _signature_ of the metric changes
- For $r>2GM$, $\boldsymbol{e}_{0}$ is _timelike_ and $\boldsymbol{e}_{i}$ are _spacelike_ vectors, as expected

- For $0<r<2GM$, $\boldsymbol{e}_{0}$ is _spacelike_ and $\boldsymbol{e}_{i}$ are _timelike_ vectors
- A particle _cannot stay fixed_ inside the region

## Causal structure
- The _causal structure_ is determined by the [[Special Relativity#Light cone structure|light cone structure]], given by the _collection of null geodesics_

### Radial null geodesics
- Consider the _radial null geodesics_:
$$ds^{2}=0=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)dt^{2}-\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)^{-1}dr^{2}$$
- This gives the curves:
$$\frac{dt}{dr}=\pm\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)^{-1}$$
- One can already observe that for $r\to 2GM$, this _tends to infinity_ 
	- Movement in $r$ becomes _infinitely slow_ with respect to $t$

- The plus solution:
$$t=r+2GM \ln \left| \frac{r}{2GM}-1 \right| +\text{const.}$$
- For $r>2GM$, it gives _outgoing geodesics_

- The minus solution:
$$t=-r-2GM \ln \left| \frac{r}{2GM}-1 \right| +\text{const.}$$
- For $r<2GM$, it gives _ingoing geodesics_
- The two solutions are related by _time-reversal_
	- The metric is _symmetric under time-reversal_

- The family of geodesics:
![[Schwrazchild null geodesics.png|600]]
- For $r\to \infty$, they approach the $t=\pm r$ geodesics of the _Minkowski metric_
### Reaching r=2GM from infinity
- As $r$ _approaches_ $2GM$, the light cones get more _steep_
- It seems to take an _infinite amount of coordinate time_

- Despite infinite coordinate time, there is a _finite change in the affine parameter_
- The _radial geodesic equation_ gives:
$$\frac{dr}{d\lambda}=\pm E$$
- Therefore, _ingoing photons_ take a _finite interval in_ $\lambda$ to get to $r=2GM$ from the outside

### Crossing r=2GM and the event horizon
- As the photon starts outside,  $E>0$, and once _inside_, $dt/d\lambda$ is _negative_ (hence, $t$ _decreases_)
	- Artifact of the _coordinate system_ behaving poorly (coordinate, instead of absolute singularity)
- Any _light emitted_ from near the event horizon is also _infinitely_ [[#Gravitational redshift|red-shifted]] 

- Once inside, _all future-pointing light-cones_ will point _inwards_
	- To determine _orientation_, consider the direction of _timelike geodesics_
- Hence, _any particle_ that goes past $r=2GM$ will _always fall towards the singularity_

- The _hypersurface_ $r=2GM$ is an _event horizon_, as particles can only go _one way_

### Outgoing geodesics
- All _outgoing light_ seems to _originate from_ $r=2GM$ at $t=-\infty$
- Like before, it takes a _finite interval_ in $\lambda$ to travel from $2GM$ to outside
- The _forward light cone_ is always _outwards_

- It is a _white hole_ that always _expels_ matter from $r=2GM$

### Radially infalling massive particle
- Consider a _radial, timelike_ [[#Orbits as geodesics|geodesic for a massive particle]]:
$$\frac{1}{2}\dot{r}^{2}-\frac{GM}{r}=\frac{1}{2}(E^{2}-1)$$
- Let the particle be _at rest at infinity_, giving $E=1$
- An _infalling_ particle obeys:
$$\displaylines{\dot{r}=-\sqrt{ \frac{2GM}{r} } \\ \tau-\tau_{0}=\frac{2}{3} \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2GM }}(r_{0}^{3/2}-r^{3/2})}$$
- It takes a _finite proper time_ to get to $r=0$

- Calculating the _coordinate time_ as a function of radial distance:
$$t-t_{0}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2GM }}\left[ 2(2GM)^{3/2}\tanh^{-1}\left( \sqrt{ \frac{r}{2GM} } \right)-\frac{2}{3}r^{3/2}-4GM \sqrt{ r }\right]$$
- The integral _diverges_ as $r\to 2GM$, indicating that it still takes an _infinite coordinate time_ to reach the event horizon:
![[Infalling proper time.png|500]]

- Once in the black hole, the worldlines can _only point inwards_:
![[Timelike geodesic black hole.png|450]]
## Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates
- One can better describe the system with coordinates _not singular at_ $r=2GM$
	- $dt/dr$ becomes _infinite_ at $r=2GM$
- Use a coordinate system $(t,r^{*},\theta,\phi)$ where the _radial null curves_ are:
$$t=\pm r^{*}+\text{const.}$$
- The _tortoise coordinate_ $r^{*}$:
$$r^{*}=r+2GM\ln \left| \frac{r}{2GM}-1 \right| $$
- The Schwarzchild metric then becomes:
$$ds^{2}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)\left(dt^{2}-{dr^{*}}^{2}\right)-r^{2}d\Omega^{2}$$
- Although the radial null curves are _constant_, $r=2GM$ is _pushed_ to $r^{*}=-\infty$

- Then define the coordinates $u$ and $v$ such that:
	- _Ingoing_ radial null geodesics satisfy $v=\text{const.}$
	- _Outgoing_ radial null geodesics satisfy $u=\text{const.}$
$$v=t+r^{*}\hspace{1.5cm}u=t-r^{*}$$
- These are the _Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates_

### Ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates
- To describe an _infalling_ particle, replace $t$ with $v$:
$$ds^{2}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)dv^{2}-2dr dv-r^{2}d\Omega^{2}$$
- The coordinates are _no longer singular_ at $r=2GM$

- The _radial light cone_ satisfies:
$$\frac{dv}{dr}=0\hspace{1.5cm} \frac{dv}{dr}=\frac{2}{1-2GM /r}$$
- One branch of the light cone is _always along the geodesic_, on a surface of constant $v$
- The other leg becomes _vertical_ at $r=2GM$
![[Ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein light cones.png]]


- _Alternatively_, define the coordinate $t^{*}$:
$$\displaylines{t^{*}=v-r \\ ds^{2}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right){dt^{*}}^{2}-\frac{4GM}{r}dt^{*}dr-\left( 1+\frac{2GM}{r} \right)dr^{2}-r^{2}d\Omega^{2}}$$
![[Ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein 1.png]]

- If a photon is _outgoing_, they still appear to _originate_ from $t=-\infty$
### Outgoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates
- Similarly, replace $t$ with $u$:
$$ds^{2}=\left( 1-\frac{2GM}{r} \right)du^{2}+2dr du-r^{2}d\Omega^{2}$$
- Similarly, the coordinates are not singular at $r=2GM$

- The _radial light cone_ then satisfies:
$$\frac{du}{dr}=0 \hspace{1.5cm} \frac{du}{dr}=-\frac{2}{1-2GM /r}$$
- Again, one branch of the light cone is along the geodesic, with _constant_ $u$
- The other branch is vertical at $r=2GM$
![[Outgoing Eddington-Finkelstein light cones.png]]
![[Outgoing Eddington-Finkelstein.png]]

- If a photon is _ingoing_, they still tend to $t=\infty$

## Collapsing into a black hole
- Black holes are formed when some _spherical object collapses_ such that its radius is _smaller_ than $2GM$
	- The matter passes the event horizon, then must collapse into the singularity

- One model is the _spherical collapse of dust_
- As there is _no pressure_, they follow _timelike geodesics_

- By [[#The Schwarzchild solution|Birkhoff's theorem]], the volume _outside_ the dust follows the Schwarzchild metric
- Treat the _outermost_ dust particle as _free-falling_
![[Freefalling dustr.png]]

- Assume that the collapse starts from _infinity_, sych that $E=1$
- Consider some _observer_ at distance $r\gg GM$, who receives _photons_ from the falling dust

- The observer can only see light _emitted from_ $r>2\mu$, therefore never sees the dust go past $2\mu$
	- Light emitted _after_ $r=2\mu$ ends up in the singularity
- Light is also _increasingly redshifted_ as the dust approaches $2\mu$
- The _arrival rate_ of photons also tends to zero, therefore the dust appears _red and dim_

- Let a photon travel from $(t_{E},r_{E})$ at the edge to $(t_{R},r_{R})$
- It follows the [[#Radial null geodesics|radial null geodesic]]:
$$t_{E}-r_{E}-2GM\ln \left| \frac{r_{E}}{2GM}-1 \right|=t_{R}-r_{R}-2GM\ln \left| \frac{r_{R}}{2GM}-1 \right| $$
- For a [[#Radially infalling massive particle|massive particle]], as $r\to 2GM$:
$$t_{E}=2GM\ln \left| \frac{\sqrt{ r_{E}/(2GM) }-1}{\sqrt{ r_{E}/(2GM) }+1} \right|+\text{const.} $$
- One can then substitute this in the formula for $t_R$ then _approximate_:
$$t_{R}\approx-4GM\ln\left( \frac{r_{E}}{2GM}-1 \right)$$

- One can then solve for $r_{E}(t_{R})$, with some constant $a$:
$$r_{E}(t_{R})=2GM+a\exp\left( -\frac{t_{R}}{4GM} \right)$$
- The _observed radius_ decreases _exponentially_ towards $2GM$, with some _characteristic time_ $4GM/c$

- The _ratio of frequencies_ is calculated by:
$$\frac{\nu_{R}}{\nu_{E}}=\frac{(p_{R})_{\mu}(U_{R})^{\mu}}{(p_{E})_{\mu}(U_{E})^{\mu}}$$
- By substituting results for the _geodesics_ for each particle, one finds:
$$\frac{\nu_{R}}{\nu_{E}}\approx \frac{1}{2}a\exp\left( -\frac{t_{R}}{4GM} \right)$$
- The observed frequency _decays exponentially_

# Cosmology
- Cosmology concerns the _evolution_ of the universe on a _large scale_

## Homogeneity and isotropy in space
- On a _large scale_, one can adopt the principle that the universe is _homogeneous_ and _isotropic_
- _Isotropy_ means that at some point on the manifold, space _looks the same_ no matter what direction one looks
	- A manifold $M$ is isotropic about point $p$, if for any two vectors $V$ and $W$ in the _tangent space_ $T_{p}M$, there is an _isometry_ of $M$ such that the pushforward of $W$ under the isometry is _parallel_ to $V$ _before the pushforward_
- _Homogeneity_ is the statement that the _metric is the same throughout the manifold_
	- Given _any two points_ $p$ and $q$ in $M$, there is an _isometry_ that takes $p$ into $q$

- A manifold can be _isotropic without being homogeneous_, or _vice versa_

- However, if space is _isotropic everywhere_, then it is _also homogeneous_
- If it is _isotropic about a point_, and _also homogeneous_, then it is _isotropic everywhere_

- _Homogeneity and isotropy together_ implies that a space is [[#Maximally symmetric spaces|maximally symmetric]]
	- They imply invariance in translations and rotations respectively

- However, the universe is _only maximally symmetric in space_, and _not time_

### Restriction on coordinates
- Coordinates must _co-move_ with the universe for it to be _isotropic_
	- Otherwise, a _relative 3-velocity_ with the universe _breaks_ the isotropy
- Observers must be _free-falling_

- If one considers the universe as a _fluid_, the _hypersurfaces_ of _constant proper density_ must be _orthogonal_ to the world-line of the observer
- _Local measurements_ of density in instantaneous rest-space then reveals _no spatial gradients_, which _preserves isotropy_
- Therefore, _local rest-spaces_ must be _tangent_ to hypersurfaces of constant proper density
![[Co-moving worldlines.png]]

- The hypersurfaces of _constant proper density_ can be labelled by _proper time_ as measured by the fundamental observer
	- It is known as _synchronous time_ $x^{0}=t$
## Robertson-Walker metrics
- Any coordinates must follow the principles listed above

### Co-moving coordinates
- As the universe is _spatially_ homogeneous and isotropic, and _evolving in time_, consider spacetime to be $\mathbb{R}\times\Sigma$, where $\mathbb{R}$ represents _time_, and $\Sigma$ is a maximally symmetric _three-manifold_
- The metric then takes the form:
$$ds^{2}=dt^{2}-R^{2}(t)d\sigma^{2}$$
- $R(t)$ is the _scale factor_
- $d\sigma^{2}$ is the _metric_ on $\Sigma$
$$d\sigma^{2}=\gamma_{ij}(u)du^{i}du^{j}$$
- $(u^{1},u^{2},u^{3})$ are the _coordinates_ on $\Sigma$ and $\gamma_{ij}$ is the _maximally symmetric_ 3D metric
- The scale factor gives _how big the spacelike slice_ $\Sigma$ is at the moment $t$

- _Coordinates_ where the metric is _free of cross-terms_, and the coefficient for $dt^{2}$ is _independent of_ $u^{i}$ are the _co-moving coordinates_
	- The coordinates _move with the fundamental observer_, and observes an isotropic universe

### Form of the Robertson-Walker metric
- Given the _maximally symmetric three-dimensional metric_ $\gamma_{ij}$, the [[#Riemann tensor for a maximally symmetric space|Riemann tensor]] is
	- It is _only_ associated with the 3-metric $\gamma_{ij}$ instead of all spacetime
$$^{(3)}R_{ijkl}=K(\gamma_{ik}\gamma_{jl}-\gamma_{il}\gamma_{jk})$$
- where $K$ is:
$$K=\frac{R}{6}$$
- The _Ricci tensor_ is:
$$^{(3)}R_{jl}=2K\gamma_{jl}$$
- If the 3-space is maximally symmetric, then it must be _spherically symmetric_ as well
- From the [[#Deriving the Schwarzchild metric|Schwarzchild metric]], with $\bar{r}$ as the radial coordinate: 
$$d\sigma^{2}=\gamma_{ij}du^{i}du^{j}=\exp(2\beta(\bar{r}))\,d \bar{r}^{2}+\bar{r}^{2}d\Omega^{2}$$
- Calculating corresponding components of the _Ricci tensor_, and setting them as _proportional to the metric_:
	- Same as derivation for Schwarzchild metric, but $\alpha=0$ and flipping spacelike signs
$$d\sigma^{2}=\frac{d \bar{r}^{2}}{1-k \bar{r}^{2}}+\bar{r}^{2}\,d\Omega^{2}$$
- One can _normalise_ $k$ such that $0<k<1$
	- The _physical size_ of the manifold can be _absorbed_ into $R(t)$

### Curvature of the 3-manifold
- $k$ indicates _curvature_ of the 3-manifold
	- The $k=-1$ case corresponds to _constant negative curvature_ on $\Sigma$
	- The $k=0$ case corresponds to _no curvature_ on $\Sigma$
	- The $k=+1$ case corresponds to _constant positive curvature_ on $\Sigma$

- One can introduce a _new radial coordinate_:
$$d\chi=\frac{d\bar{r}}{\sqrt{ 1-k\bar{r}^{2} }}$$
- This can then be _integrated_ to obtain:
$$\bar{r}=S_{k}(\chi)\equiv \begin{cases}\sin \chi &k=+1 \\ \chi&k=0\\ \sinh \chi&k=-1\end{cases}$$
- This gives the _metric_:
$$d\sigma^{2}=d\chi^{2}+S_{k}^{2}(\chi)d\Omega^{2}$$

- For the _flat case_ $k=0$:
$$d\sigma^{2}=d\chi^{2}+\chi^{2}d\Omega^{2}=dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2}$$
- This is _flat 3-dimensional Euclidean space_
	- _Globally_, it could describe $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ or the 3-torus $S^{1}\times S^{1}\times S^{1}$

- For the _closed case_ $k=+1$:
$$d\sigma^{2}=d\chi^{2}+\sin^{2}\chi \,d\Omega^{2}$$
- This is the metric of a _three-sphere_

- For the _open case_ $k=-1$:
$$d\sigma^{2}=d\chi^{2}+\sinh^{2}\chi\,d\Omega^{2}$$
- This is a metric for a 3-dimensional space of _constant negative curvature_
	- Generalisation of the _hyperboloid_

### Robertson-Walker metric with scale factor
- The form of the metric:
$$ds^{2}=dt^{2}-R^{2}(t)\left[\frac{d \bar{r}^{2}}{1-k \bar{r}^{2}}+\bar{r}^{2}\,d\Omega^{2}\right]$$
- If one _scales_:
$$R\to\lambda^{-1}R\hspace{1cm}\bar{r}\to\lambda \bar{r}\hspace{1cm}k\to\lambda^{-2}k$$
- Therefore, one can _normalise_ $k$ such that $-1<k<-1$
- This gives $R$ units of _distance_ and makes $\bar{r}$ _dimensionless_

- Instead, one can use a _dimensionless scale factor_. with a radial coordinate of _dimensions of length_:
$$a(t)=\frac{R(t)}{R_{0}}\hspace{1cm}r=R_{0}\bar{r}\hspace{1cm} \kappa=\frac{k}{R_{0}^{2}}$$

- Here, $\kappa$ can take _any value_, giving the Robertson-Walker metric:
$$ds^{2}=dt^{2}-a^{2}(t)\left[ \frac{dr^{2}}{1-\kappa r^{2}}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2} \right] $$
### Connection and curvature tensor
- Christoffel symbols:



- Setting $\dot{a}\equiv da/dt$, one can also calculate the _Ricci scalar_:
$$R=6\left[ \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}+\left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^{2}+\frac{\kappa}{a^{2}} \right]$$


## Behaviour of the scale factor
- The Robertson-Walker metric is defined for _any behaviour_ of $a(t)$
- It can then be substituted into [[#Einstein's equation]] to derive the _Friedmann equation_, which relates $a(t)$ to the _energy-momentum_ of the universe

### Universe as a fluid and the equation of state
- One can _model the universe as a fluid_

- In _co-moving_ coordinates, the fluid is _at rest_, giving the 4-velocity:
$$U^{\mu}=(1,0,0,0)$$
- This gives the [[Special Relativity#Perfect fluid|energy-momentum tensor]]:
$$T^{\mu \nu}=(\rho +p)U^{\mu}U^{\nu}-pg^{\mu \nu}$$
- This has the _trace_:
$${T^{\mu}}_{\mu}=\rho-3p$$

- From its [[Special Relativity#Conservation|conservation]] in the $0-$component:
$$\nabla_{\mu}T^{\mu 0}=\partial_{0}p+3 \frac{\dot{a}}{a}(\rho +p)$$
- One can choose an _equation of state_ for the fluid:
$$p=w\rho$$
- In mose cases, $w$ is _constant_ and depends on the type of fluid
	- The _null dominant energy condition_ allowing for _vacuum energy_, but not the _destabilisation_ of vacuum, gives $|w|\leq 1$
- Conservation of energy becomes:
$$\frac{\dot{\rho}}{\rho}=-3(1+w) \frac{\dot{a}}{a}$$
- If $w$ is _constant_, this gives:
$$\rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}$$

### Matter and radiation dominated universes
- _Matter_ (Dust) is a set of _collisionless, nonrelativistic particles_, which essentially have _zero pressure_:
$$p_{M}=0$$
- Examples: _stars_ and _galaxies_
- Hence, for a _matter-dominated universe_:
$$\rho_{M}\propto a^{-3}$$
- This gives a _decrease in number density_
- The energy is _dominated by rest energy_

- _Radiation_ describes _photons_, or particles _moving at ultrarelativistic speeds_
- The [[Classical Field Theory#Free electromagnetic field|electromagnetic field tensor]]:
$$T^{\mu \nu}={F^{\mu}}_{\lambda}F^{\lambda \nu}-\frac{1}{4}g^{\mu \nu}F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}$$
- The _trace_ is zero, giving:
$$p_{R}=\frac{1}{3}\rho_{R}$$
- Hence, for a _radiation-dominated universe_:
$$\rho_{M}\propto a^{-4}$$
- As the _number density_ falls off as $a^{-3}$, and the photons also undergo [[#Cosmological redshift]] $\lambda \propto a$

- The _current universe_ has $\rho_{M}/\rho_{R}\sim 10^{3}$

- As for [[#Cosmological constant and vacuum energy|vacuum energy]], $p_{\Lambda}=-\rho_{\Lambda}$, giving:
$$\rho_{\Lambda}\propto a^{0}$$

- As the universe _expands_, in the long term, it can become _vacuum-dominated_

### The Friedmann equations
- [[#Cosmological constant and vacuum energy|Einstein's equation with cosmological constant]]:
$$R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu \nu}+\Lambda g_{\mu \nu}=-8\pi GT_{\mu \nu}$$
- By using components of the FRW [[#Connection and curvature tensor|curvature tensor]]:
$$R_{00}=3 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}\hspace{1.5cm}R_{ij}=$$
- This gives the _Friedmann equations_:
$$\displaylines{3 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}=-4\pi G(\rho +3p)+\Lambda \\ \left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^{2}+\frac{\kappa}{a^{2}}=\frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho+\frac{1}{3}\Lambda}$$

### Parameters
- The _rate of expansion_ in co-moving coordinates is characterised by the _Hubble parameter_:
$$H=\frac{\dot{a}}{a}$$
- The current value $H_{0}=(70\pm 10)\,\text{km/sec/Mpc}$
- One can define the _Hubble length_ and _Hubble time_:
$$d_{H}=H_{0}^{-1}c\hspace{1.5cm}t_{H}=H_{0}^{-1}$$
- There is also the _density parameter_:
$$\Omega=\frac{8\pi G}{3H^{2}}\rho=\frac{\rho}{\rho _\text{crit}}$$
- $\rho _\text{crit}$ is the _critical density_
- The Friedmann equation for $\Lambda=0$ can be written as:
$$\Omega-1=\frac{\kappa}{H^{2}a^{2}}$$
- The _sign_ of $\kappa$ is determined by the magnitude of $\Omega$

|         Density          | Density parameter | Curvature  | Universe geometry |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| $\rho<\rho _\text{crit}$ |    $\Omega<1$     | $\kappa<0$ |       Open        |
| $\rho=\rho _\text{crit}$ |    $\Omega=1$     | $\kappa=0$ |       Flat        |
| $\rho>\rho _\text{crit}$ |    $\Omega>1$     | $\kappa>0$ |      Closed       |
- Hence, the density parameter gives the _curvature_ of the universe
## Redshifts and distances
- For the FRW metric, there are _no timelike Killing tensors_
	- Therefore, the method from the [[#Gravitational redshift|Schwarzchild metric]] does not apply
- However, there is a [[#Killing vectors and tensors, Killing's equation|Killing tensor]]

### Conserved quantity
- A _co-moving observer_ has 4-velocity $U^{\mu}=(1,0,0,0)$
- The _Killing tensor_ is:
$$K_{\mu \nu}=-a^{2}(g_{\mu \nu}+U_{\mu}U_{\nu})\hspace{1.5cm}\nabla_{(\sigma}K_{\mu \nu)}=0$$
- If some particle has _4-velocity_ $V^{\mu}=dx^{\mu}/d\lambda$, the [[#Killing vectors and tensors, Killing's equation|conserved quantity]] is:
$$K^{2}=K_{\mu \nu}V^{\mu}V^{\nu}=-a^{2}[V_{\mu}V^{\mu}+(U_{\mu}V^{\mu})^{2}]$$
- Substituing $U^{\mu}$, for a _massive particle_ where $V_{\mu}V^{\mu}=1$:
$$|\boldsymbol{V}|=\sqrt{ V_{i}V^{i}}=\frac{K}{a}$$
- Hence, the particle _slows down_ with respect to the _co-moving observer_
	- A _gas_ of particles with _initially high_ relative velocities that _cools down_ eventually

- Alternatively, use the [[#Alternate form of geodesic equation|alternate form]] of the geodesic equation:
$$\frac{d^2x_\mu}{d\tau^2}=\frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu g_{\nu\lambda}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\lambda}{d\tau}$$
- For a particle travelling _radially_:
$$p_{\mu}=(p_{0},p_{1},0,0) \implies p_{1}=\text{const.}$$
### Cosmological redshift
- For _null geodesics_, where $V_{\mu}V^{\mu}=0$:
$$U_{\mu}V^{\mu}=-\frac{K}{a}$$
- This is the _frequency of the photon as measured by a co-moving observer_

- This then gives:
$$\frac{\omega _\text{obs}}{\omega _\text{em}}=\frac{a_\text{em}}{a_\text{obs}}$$
- The _cosmological redshift_:
$$z_\text{em}=\frac{\lambda _\text{obs}-\lambda _\text{em}}{\lambda _\text{em}}$$
- If the observation is done _today_ with $a_\text{obs}=a_{0}=1$:
$$a_\text{em}=\frac{1}{1+z_\text{em}}$$
- This is _due to spatial expansion_ instead of relative velocities

- Alternatively, considering that $p_{1}$ is _constant_ for radial motion, for a _null geodesic_:
$$p_{0}=\frac{p_1}{a}=U_{\mu}V^{\mu}\implies p_{0}a=\omega a=\text{const.}$$
### Distances and Hubble's Law
- If one observes objects over distances that are _small_ compared to _Hubble length_ $H_{0}^{-1}$ and _radius of spatial curvature_ $\kappa^{-1/2}$, expansion _is observed as a set of objects moving apart from each other_
	- Leads to observations similar to the _conventional Doppler effect_:
$$v=cz$$
- Within this _small distance approximation_, the "distance" to an object is taken as the _instantaneous physical distance_ $d_{P}$ on the spatial hypersurface

- Write the metric as:
$$ds^{2}=dt^{2}-a^{2}(t)R_{0}^{2}\left[ d\chi^{2}+S_{k}^{2}(\chi)d\Omega^{2} \right] $$
- The _instantaneous physical distance_ from the observer $\chi=0$, and an object at _co-moving radial distance_ $\chi$:
$$d_{P}(t)=a(t)R_{0}\chi$$
- As the observer and galaxy are _co-moving_, $\chi$ is _constant_
- One then gets a _"velocity"_:
$$v=\dot{d}_{P}=\frac{\dot{a}}{a}d_{P}=H_{0}d_{P}$$
- This is _Hubble's Law_

- $d_{P}$ is _not inherently observable_, as it is on the current _spatial hypersurface_, and _observations are events from the past light cone_
- It also _ignores curvature of the hypersurface_ 

## Evolution of the scale factor
- Given a specification of _amounts of energy density_ $\rho_{i}$ for different _species_ $i$, with their _equation of state_ $p_{i}=p_{i}(\rho_{i})$, and the _spatial curvature_ $\kappa$, one can _solve_ [[#The Friedmann equations]]

### General behaviour
- The different components of energy density:
$$\rho_{i}=\rho_{i 0} a^{-n_{i}}$$
- Comparing to the [[#Universe as a fluid and the equation of state|equation of state]]:
$$w_{i}=\frac{1}{3}n_{i}-1$$
- Define a _fictitious energy density

- Subtlety: $\ddot{a}$ and $\dot{H}$

### Special cases
- Consider $\Lambda=0$, with $\rho>0$ and $p\geq 0$:
$$\frac{\ddot{a}}{a}=-\frac{4\pi G}{3}(\rho +3p)$$
- This implies $\ddot{a}<0$, and $a=0$ at some time in the _past_
- This is the _Big Bang_

- As $\ddot{a}<0$, this implies that the _age of the universe_ is _smaller_ than the Hubble time:
$$T_\text{uni}< \frac{a(t_{0})}{\dot{a}(t_{0})}=\frac{1}{H_{0}}$$
![[Age of universe.png|250]]

- In a _flat or open universe_ $(\kappa\leq0)$:
$$H^{2}=\frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho-\frac{\kappa}{a^{2}}>0$$
- The universe will _always be expanding_

- In a _closed universe_ $(\kappa>0)$, there is a _scale factor_ $a_\text{max}$ where:
$$\frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho =\frac{\kappa}{a_\text{max}^{2}}\implies H=0$$
- The universe will _stop expanding_, and eventually _contract_ $(\ddot{a}<0)$

### Einstein-de Sitter model
- Consider a _flat universe_ with _vanishing_ $\Lambda$

- For a _matter dominated universe_ $(p=0, \rho \propto a^{-3})$
$$\left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^{2}\propto \frac{1}{a^{3}} \implies a \propto t^{2/3} \hspace{1cm}H=\frac{2}{3t}$$
- For a _radiation dominated universe_ $(\rho \propto a^{-4})$
	- For _sufficiently early times_
$$\left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^{2}\propto \frac{1}{a^{4}} \implies a \propto t^{1/2} \hspace{1cm}H=\frac{1}{2t}$$

### Large cosmological constant
- For a _sufficiently large_ $\Lambda$, $\ddot{a}>0$

- For a _flat universe_, at _late times_:
$$H^{2}=\frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho +\frac{1}{3}\Lambda\to \frac{1}{3}\Lambda$$
- The Hubble parameter _tends to a constant value_
- The _asymptotic behaviour_ of the scale factor:
$$a(t) \propto \exp\left( \sqrt{ \frac{\Lambda}{3} }t \right)$$
- This is the _de Sitter universe_
