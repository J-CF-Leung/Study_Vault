- Many principles from [[Special Relativity]] still apply:
	- The laws of physics are _invariant_ across _inertial reference frames_
	- The _speed of causality_ for _all observers_ is the _speed of light in vacuum_ $c$
	- There is _no longer absolute time or simultaneity_
- Like special relativity, laws are written in terms of _geometric objects_, such as _vectors_ and _tensors_

- Notation: [[Einstein notation]]
- Apply the language of [[Special Relativity#Component representation|tensors, covariant and contravariant components]]
# Motivation

## The weak equivalence principle
- _Newtonian_ gravity asserts that the _gravitational force_ felt by an object is determined by some _gravitational potential_ $\Phi_G$
- Let there be some _passive gravitational mass_ $m_G$, the force on it is:
$$\bm{F}=-m_G\nabla\Phi_G$$
- The potential is determined by a _mass density_ $\rho$:
$$\nabla^2\Phi_G=4\pi G\rho$$
- This implies that the potential can _change instantly throughout space_, which is already _inconsistent with special relativity_

- This _mass density_ is _not necessarily required to be the passive gravitational mass_
- Instead, define it as an _active gravitational mass_, where such a point mass has density:
$$\rho(\bm{x},t)=m_A\delta^3(\bm{x}-\bm{y}(t))$$
- Let there be mass $m_{G,1}$ at $\bm{x}_1$ at time $t$, and another mass $m_{A,2}$ at $\bm{x}_2$ also at time $t$, then the corresponding _forces_ are:
$$\displaylines{\bm{F}_{1\text{ on }2}=Gm_{A,1}m_{G,2}\frac{\bm{x}_1-\bm{x}_2}{|\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1|^3}\\\bm{F}_{2\text{ on }1}=Gm_{G,1}m_{A,2}\frac{\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1}{|\bm{x}_2-\bm{x}_1|^3}}$$
- Due to _momemtum conservation_, they are _equal and opposite_, hence:
$$m_{A,1}m_{G,2}=m_{G,1}m_{A,2}$$
- Therefore, the _ratio_ between $m_A$ and $m_G$ must be _constant for all masses_, and this ratio can be _absorbed_ into the _gravitational constant_ $G$

- Meanwhile, from _Newton's second law_:
$$\bm{F}=m_I\frac{d^2\bm{x}}{dt^2}$$
- where $m_I$ is the _inertial mass_
- Experiment shows that for _all masses_, $m_I/m_G$ is constant, and can be further absorbed into $G$
- This leads to the _weak equivalence principle_:
>[!info] Weak equivalence principle
>Given a gravitational field, the trajectory of a freely falling point mass depends only on their initial position and velocity, and is indepenent of structure or composition
- This is _unique to gravity_, as for _electromagnetic fields_, the trajectory depends on the _ratio between charge and mass_

## The strong equivalence principle
- Further thought experiments led to the _strong equivalence principle_:
>[!info] Strong equivalence principle
>In a small enough region of space, that is non-rotating and free-falling under some gravitational field, the laws of physics reduce to that of special relativity
- An equivalent statement is that it is _impossible to tell using local experiments_ whether one is in a _gravitational field_ or is simply _in an accelerating frame_
- If the region of space is _large_, then one can infer the existence of a gravitational field via _tidal effects_
- The equivalence principle is a _local statement_

>[!quote]
>At that moment I got the happiest thought of my life in the following form: In an example worth considering, the gravitational field has a relative existence only in a manner similar to the electric field generated by magneto-electric induction. _Because for an observer in free-fall from the roof of a house there is during the fall_—at least in his immediate vicinity—_no gravitational field._
>- Einstein in 1920, about his time at a patent office in 1907

## Conclusions
- The equivalence principles suggest that gravitational fields are determined by the _local structure of space-time_
- A _local inertial reference frame_ will still resemble the [[Special Relativity|geometry of special relativity]]
- Gravity manifests itself as the global _curvature of space-time_, caused by the presence of _matter_

- Experimental evidence (gravitational waves, mercury's precession) has shown that for _extreme gravity_, Einsteinian relativity is _much more accurate than Newtonian mechanics_

- The above conclusions motivate the description of spacetime as a _manifold_
- In _special relativity_, _Minkowski spacetime_ is a 4-dimensional manifold
- In _general relativity_, spacetime is a _manifold_ that responds _dynamically_ to mass and energy

# Manifolds, vectors, tensors and geometry
- _Informally_, an $n-$dimensional manifold is a _surface_ on which one can have a _network_ of _coordinate patches_, where the surface _resembles_ $\mathbb{R}^n$, but only _locally_
- In relativity, the _network_ is a set of _events_, and the whole _patch_ is _spacetime_

## Manifolds and coordinates
- Formally, an $n-$dimensional manifold is a _structure consisting of_:
	- A _set_ $\mathcal{M}$ of _points_ $P$
	- A _countable_ family of _subsets of_ $\mathcal{M}$, known as _fundamental coordinate patches_ $C_\alpha$, such that the _union_ of all $C_\alpha$ is the whole set $\mathcal{M}$
	- One can _map_ each $C_\alpha$ to an _open subset of_ $\mathbb{R}^n$, with each point having _coordinates_ $x^a=(x^0,x^1,\dots,x^n)$
- Generally, one is _unable_ to _cover_ the entire manifold with _one non-degenerate patch_
	- Requirement that $C_\alpha$ is mapped onto an _open subset_
- The manifold is _differentiable_ if the patches are joined _smoothly_

- Manifolds are often _embedded_ in some higher-dimensional Euclidean space
	- This is not a _necessary condition_ for a manifold to exist
- An example of a manifold is the _set of 3D rotations_ in space
- Or, a _2-sphere_ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, defined by $x^2+y^2+z^2=a^2$
	- The _spherical polar coordinates_ become _degenerate_ at the poles, so two coordinate patches are required

- The _coordinates_ of a point on a manifold are _not unique_, and can be _transformed_ (e.g. denoted $x^a\to x'^a$)
	- The _point_ itself is unaffacted by transformations as it is a _geometric object_

### Coordinate transformations
- Coordinate transformations are viewed as _passive_, as points are simply _relabelled_
- The map is denoted:
$$x^a\to x'^a=x'^a(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)$$
- Assume the function is _smooth_ and _differentiable_

- Consider two _infinitesimally close points_ $x^a$ and $x^a+dx^a$
- In the _new coordinate system_:
$$dx'^a=\pd{x'^a}{x^b}dx^b$$
- This defines a _transformation matrix_:
$$J^a_b=\pmatrix{\partial x'^1/\partial x^1 & \dots & \partial x'^1/\partial x^n \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \partial x'^1/\partial x^n & \dots & \partial x'^n/\partial x^n}$$
- The _determinant_ $J\equiv\text{det}(J^a_b)$ is known as the _Jacobian_ of the transformation
- If $J\neq0$ for _some range_ of coordinates, the transformation is _locally invertible_:
$$\displaylines{x^a=x^a(x'^1,x'^2,\dots x'^n) \\ \pd{x'^a}{x_b}\pd{x_b}{x'^c}=\delta^a_c}$$
- The _determinant_ of the inverse is then $1/J$
## Structures on a manifold
- Once manifolds are defined, one can support _objects_ on this manifold
	- _Scalar fields_ $\phi(x^a)$
	- _Curves_ $x^\mu(s)$
	- _Surfaces_ $x^\mu(s^1,s^2,\dots s^m)$
	- _Tangent vectors_ $dx^\mu/ds|_{s_0}$ _along a curve_
	- _Tangent spaces_, a collection of _tangent vectors for all curves passing through a point $s_0$_, which forms a _vector space_, with the _same dimension_ as the _manifold_

- A _scalar field_ is the simplest structure, a _map_ assigning each point $P$ a _number_ (real or complex), which can be expressed as a _function of coordinates_ $\phi(x^a)$
- This value is _independent of coordinate system_
- Therefore, if one performs a _coordinate transformation_ $x_a\to x'^a$, one must define a _new function_:
$$\phi(x^a)=\phi'(x'^a)$$
### Curves and surfaces
- Curves and surfaces are _subsets_ of points on a manifold
- A _curve_ is defined _parametrically_, with a single parameter:
$$x^\mu=x^\mu(s)$$
- Meanwhile, a _surface_, or _submanifold_ of dimensionality $m$ requires $m$ parameters:
	- $m<n$, the dimensionality of the embedding space
$$x^\mu=x^\mu(s^1,s^2,\dots s^m)$$
- The _special case_ $m=n-1$ is known as a _hypersurface_
- One is able to _eliminate_ the parameters from the $n$ equations, such that there is _some function_ $f$:
$$f(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)=0$$

- Similarly, for some $m-$dimensional surface, one can have $n-m$ constraints:
$$f_1(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)=0,\dots, f_{n-m}(x^1,x^2,\dots x^n)=0$$
- This is the _intersection_ of $n-m$ hypersurfaces, as an _alternative to the parametric representation_
### Vectors and the tangent space
- On a manifold, _vectors_ are _associated with the points themselves_
	- In other words, they are _local_
	- Vectors from _one point to another_ will _have no meaning_ as _parallel displacement is not possible_ on a _curved manifold_
	- This also means one _cannot add vectors associated with different points_
- They must be _defined_ as being an element of the _tangent space_ at that point
	- It is an $n-$dimensional _subspace_ of the embedding space
	- One can also define the _tangent bundle_ for manifold $M$, denoted $T(M)$, which is the _set of all tangent spaces_, forming a $2n-$dimensional manifold 

- One must define the _tangent space_ using objects _intrinsic to the manifold_ $M$
- Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the _space of all smooth functions_ on the manifold
	- $C^\infty$ maps $f:M\to\mathbb{R}$ 
- Any _curve_ passing through some point $p$ defines a _directional derivative_ $f\to df/ds|_p$

- The _tangent space_ $T_p$ is then the _space of directional derivative operators along curves_
	- One can demonstrate that the operators fulfill the requirement for a _vector space_

- The _basis_ of a tangent space is the set of vectors $\hat{e}_\mu=\partial_\mu=\partial/\partial x^\mu$
	- _Any_ directional derivative is a _linear combination_ of $\{\partial_\mu\}$
$$\vec{V}=V^\mu\pd{}{x^\mu}$$

- From the _chain rule_, one gets the _transformation law_ for basis vectors:
$$\partial_{\mu'}=\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\partial_\mu$$
- One then gets the _transformation law for components_ of vector $V=V^\mu\partial_\mu$:
$$\displaylines{V^\mu\partial_\mu=V^{\mu'}\partial_{\mu'}=V^{\mu'}\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\partial_\mu \\ V^{\mu'}=\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\mu}V^\mu}$$
- This transformation is _not necessarily linear_

- The _tangent vector_ to a curve $x^a(u)$ can then be defined:
$$\frac{d}{du}=\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\pd{}{x^\mu}$$
- These vectors are _contravariant_
### Covariant/dual vectors
- One can define _covariant vectors_
- For example, the _gradient_ of a _scalar field_:
$$X_\mu=\pd{\phi}{x^\mu}$$
- The _component transformation_:
$$X_{\mu'}=\pd{\phi'}{x^{\mu'}}=\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{\phi}{x^\nu}=\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\mu'}}X_\nu$$
- This is a _covariant vector_, which inabits the _dual space_ to that of the contravariant vectors

- The _basis_ in this dual space are then the _gradients_ $\hat{e}^\mu=dx^\mu$
	- One can verify that they are _orthonormal_ to the other basis:
	$$\hat{e}^\mu\cdot\hat{e}_\nu=\pd{x^\mu}{x^\nu}={\delta^\mu}_\nu$$

- _Summing_ a product of _contravariant_ and _covariant_ vectors makes a _scalar_, which is _invariant under transformations_:
$$X_{\mu'}V^{\mu'}=\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\lambda}X_\nu V^\lambda={\delta^\nu}_\lambda X_\nu V^\lambda=X_\nu V^\nu$$
## The metric tensor
- The _geometry_ of a manifold is defined by its _metric_
- Consider two _neighbouring points_ on a manifold, with coordinates $x^\mu$ and $x^\mu+dx^\mu$
- The _local geometry_ there is given by the _interval_

- On a _Riemannian manifold_, the interval takes the form:
$$ds^2=g_{\mu\nu}(x)dx^\mu dx^\nu$$
- The interval is _quadratic in coordinate differentials_
- $g_{\mu\nu}$ are components of the _metric tensor_
	- Each component is known as a _metric function_, which is _dependent on the point onb the manifold_ at which it is evaluated
	- Components are _dependent on coordinate system_

- The geometry is _Riemannian_ if $ds^2>0$, and _pseudo-Riemannian_ if not
- Example: the _Minkowski metric_ $\eta_{\mu\nu}$, where $ds^2=dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2$

- The metric can always be chosen as _symmetric_
	- The _antisymmetric_ part contributes _zero to the interval_
- From this, for an $N-$dimensional manifold, there are $N(N+1)/2$ _independent metric functions_ at each point
- If the metric is _diagonal_ $(g_{\mu\nu}=0\;\; \forall\mu\neq\nu)$, the coordinate system is _orthogonal_
	- Example: The Minkowski metric

- As the interval is _invariant under transformations_:
$$\displaylines{ds^2=g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu dx^\nu=g_{\mu'\nu'}\,dx^{\mu'}dx^{\nu'} \\ g_{\mu'\nu'}(x')=\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\nu'}}\,g_{\mu\nu}(x(x'))}$$
- As there are $N$ _arbitrary_ coordinate transformations one can perform, there are only $N(N-1)/2$ _independent functional degrees of freedom_ for the tensor

### Square of the tangent vector
- The [[#Curves and surfaces|tangent vector]] to a curve $x^\mu(u)$:
$$\frac{d}{du}=\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\pd{}{x^\mu}$$
- Then take the _squared length_:
$$g\left(\frac{d}{du},\frac{d}{du}\right)=g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\frac{dx^\nu}{du}$$
- On a _pseudo-Riemannian manifold_:
$$g\left(\frac{d}{du},\frac{d}{du}\right)=\begin{cases}>0&\text{ if timelike} \\ <0 &\text{ if spacelike} \\ =0&\text{ if null}\end{cases}$$
- Therefore, a curve can be _classified_ as timelike, spacelike, or null based on the metric
- For a _non-null_ curve, the _length_ of the tangent vector is the _derivative_ of the _proper path length_ $s$ w.r.t. $u$:
$$\left|\frac{ds}{du}\right|=\left|g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\right|$$
## Local geometry
- The _intrinsic geometry_ of a manifold is characterised by the _line element_
	- It is _independent_ of any _embedding_ in higher-dimensional space

- Example: a _cylindrical surface_ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$
	- The interval is $ds^2=dz^2+ad\phi^2$
	- It is _locally identical_ to a 2D plane, as one can make a _transformation_ $ds^2=dz'^2+dy'^2$
	- This transformation can be made _everywhere_, as a _2D sheet_ can be _continuously rolled_ into a cylinder, so its _intrinsic geometry_ is said to be _identical to the Euclidean plane_
	- The _extrinsic geometry_ is seen in $\mathbb{R}^3$, where it is _curved_
- Example: a _2-sphere_ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$
	- The interval is $ds^2=a^2d\theta^2+a^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2$
	- While it is _locally identical_, the transformation _cannot be made over the whole sphere_
	- The sphere is _intrinsically curved_
	![[2-sphere.png]]

- Generally, relativity deals with _intrinsic geometry_, which is _independent of embedding_
- While the _topology_ of the manifold is _intrinsic_, it is _non-local_, and hence _irrelevant to general relativity_

### The 2-sphere and 3-sphere
- Let there be a _2-sphere_, embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by:
$$x^2+y^2+z^2=a$$
- The _line element_ in _3-space_ is $ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+dz^2$

- From the definition of the 2-sphere, one gets the _constraint_ $xdx+ydy+zdz=0$
- Substituting $dz$, one gets the _induced line element_:
$$ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+\frac{(xdx+ydy)^2}{a^2-(x^2+y^2)}$$
- Using _plane polar coordinates_ (on the _tangent plane_):
$$\displaylines{x=\rho\cos\phi\hspace{1.5cm}y=\rho\cos\phi \\ ds^2=\frac{a^2}{a^2-\rho^2}d\rho^2+\rho^2d\phi^2}$$
- Thus, one gets the _induced metric_
- There is a _singularity_ at $\rho=a$ 
	- This corresponds to the _equator relative to the point_ at which $ds$ is evaluated
![[2-sphere polars.png]]

- Next, consider the _3-sphere_, embedded in $\mathbb{R}^4$:
$$x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2=a^2$$
- Similarly, the _induced line element_ is:
$$ds^2=dx^2+dy^2+dz^2+\frac{(xdx+ydy+zdz)^2}{a^2-(x^2+y^2+z^2)}$$
- Similarly, using _spherical polar coordinates_ in the tangent space:
$$ds^2=\frac{a^2}{a^2-r^2}dr^2+r^2d\theta^2+r^2\sin^2\theta \,d\phi^2$$
- This describes a _non-Euclidean_ 3D space
- For $a\to\infty$, one recovers _3D Euclidean space_
	- For $r\ll a$, $\mathbb{R}^3$ is recovered _locally_

- One should not try to visualise the 3-sphere
## Lengths and volumes
- Consider sume _curve_ $x^\mu(u)$ between points $A$ and $B$ on some manifold
- Since $ds^2=g_{\mu\nu}x^\mu x^\nu$ is the _invariant distance_ between neighbouring points, the _length along a curve_ is:
$$L_{AB}=\int_{u_A}^{u_B} \left|g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\right|^{1/2}du$$

- For the _volume_ of some region, assume a _diagonal_ metric, where $g_{\mu\nu}=0$ if $\mu\neq\nu$:
	- Consider the _sides_ of the element with length $ds=\sqrt{g_{ii}}dx^i$
$$dV=\sqrt{|g_{11}g_{22}\dots g_{NN}|}\,dx^1dx^2\dots dx^N$$
- The quantity in square root is the _determinant_ of the metric tensor
	- One can check that it transforms as $g'=g/J^2$, where $J$ is the [[#Coordinate transformations|Jacobian]]
- The product of differentials transforms as $dx^{1'}dx^{2'}\dots = Jdx^1dx^2\dots$
- Hence, one sees that the volume element is _invariant_:
$$dV=\sqrt{|g|}\,dx^1dx^2\dots dx^N$$
## Local Cartesian Coordinates on Riemannian manifolds
- On a _Riemannian_ manifold, it is _generally not possible_ to choose coordinates such that the _line element_ is in a _Euclidean form_ at _every point_ (i.e. make the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}=\delta_{\mu\nu}$)
	- There are $N(N+1)/2$ _independent functions_ but only $N$ _transformations_

- However, it is possible to make it _Euclidean for a small area around some given point_
- This condition corresponds to:
$$\displaylines{g_{\mu\nu}(P)=\delta_{\mu\nu}\hspace{1.5cm}\pd{g_{\mu\nu}}{x^\rho}\Bigg|_P=0 \\ g_{\mu\nu}=\delta_{\mu\nu}+O[(x-x_P)^2]}$$
- These are the _local Cartesian coordinates_ at point $P$
- This corresponds to a _local intertial frame_

- Consider the _Taylor expansion_ of the _coordinate transformation_
- One can show that since $g_{\mu\nu}'$ has $N(N+1)/2$ _independent values_, and the _coordinates_ ${\partial x'^\rho}/{\partial x'^\sigma}$ has $N^2$ _degrees of freedom_, one can _fix_ $g'_{\mu\nu}$ and still have $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom _remaining_
- Similarly, $\partial g_{\mu\nu}/\partial x^\rho$ has $N^2(N+1)/2$ _independent values_, and the _coordinates_ $\partial x'^\mu/\partial x^\rho\partial x^\sigma$ have $N^2(N+1)/2$ degrees of freedom, one can _fix_ $\partial g'_{\mu\nu}/\partial x^\rho$

- However, the _second derivatives of the metric cannot be eliminated_, and these terms give rise to the _curvature_ of the manifold 
## Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds
- For a _pseudo-Riemannian manifold_, $ds^2$ can be _zero or negative_
- This implies that the _eigenvalues_ of $g_{\mu\nu}$ can be _negative_

- One can find _local coordinates_ such that at some point:
$$g_{\mu\nu}(P)=\eta_{\mu\nu}\hspace{1.5cm}\pd{g_{\mu\nu}}{x^\rho}\Bigg|_P=0 $$
- Where the matrix $\eta_{\mu\nu}$:
$$\eta_{\mu\nu}=\text{diag}(\pm1,\pm1,\dots\pm1)$$
- The _signature_ of the manifold is the number of _positive_ entries _minus_ the number of _negative_ entries

- Example: _Minkowski spacetime_
$$\displaylines{ds^2=c^2dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2 \\ g_{\mu\nu}=\text{diag}(+1,-1,-1,-1)}$$

# Tensor algebra
- At a given point $P$ on the manifold, one can define a _tensor_, a _multilinear map_
- A $(k,l)$ tensor takes $k$ _contravariant_ vectors and $l$ _covariant_ vectors to produce a _scalar_
	- The tensor is said to have _rank $k+l$_
	- Tensor _components_ can be said to be completely _covariant, contravariant, or mixed_
- The linearity of a type $(1,1)$ tensor:
$$\begin{aligned}T(\alpha W_\mu+\beta X_\mu,\gamma V^\nu+\delta Z^\nu)&=\alpha\gamma \,T(W_\mu,V^\nu)+\alpha\delta\,T(W_\mu,Z^\nu) \\ &+ \beta\gamma \,T(X_\mu,V^\nu)+\beta\delta\,T(X_\mu,Z^\nu)\end{aligned}$$
- Like _vectors_, tensors are _geometric objects_ that are _coordinate independent_

- Its _components_ in some given basis are:
$${T^{\mu_1\dots \mu_k}}_{\nu_1\dots \nu_l}=T(dx^{\mu_1},\dots dx^{\mu_k},\partial_{\nu_1},\dots\partial_{\nu_l})$$
- Like _vector components_, tensor components can also be _transformed_:
$${T^{\mu_1'\dots \mu_k'}}_{\nu_1'\dots \nu_l'}=\pd{x^{\mu_1'}}{x^{\mu_1}}\dots \pd{x^{\mu_k'}}{x^{\mu_k}}\pd{x^{\nu_1}}{x^{\nu_1'}}\dots \pd{x^{\nu_l}}{x^{\nu_l'}}{T^{\mu_1\dots \mu_k}}_{\nu_1\dots \nu_l}$$
	- The _primed coordinates_ remain _"upstairs/downstairs" on both sides_
## Tensor operations
- _Addition_ is done _by component_:
$$(T+S)_{\mu\nu}=T_{\mu\nu}+S_{\mu\nu}$$
- One can check that this _still obeys the transformation law_

- The _outer product_ of a $(p,q)$ tensor and an $(r,s)$ tensor produces a $(p+r,q+s)$ _tensor_
- The outer product of $S$ and $T$ is _denoted_ $S\otimes T$, with _components_:
$${(S\otimes T)^{\lambda_1\dots\lambda_p\mu_1\dots\mu_r}}_{\nu_1 \dots\nu_q\xi_1\dots\xi_s}={S^{\lambda_1\dots\lambda_p}}_{\nu_1 \dots\nu_q}{T^{\mu_1\dots\mu_r}}_{\xi_1\dots\xi_s}$$
- For example, the _outer product of two contravariant vectors_ creates a $(2,0)$ _tensor_

- The operation of _contraction_ sets a _contravariant_ and _covariant_ index _equal_, then proceeds to _sum_ them
- A $(k,l)$ tensor is _contracted_ to a $(k-1,l-1)$ tensor
- The tensor $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\nu}$ has _possible contractions_ $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\lambda}$, $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\lambda}{\nu}$, and $\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\mu}$
	- They all form _vectors_, either _covariant or contravariant_
	- In general, these are _not equal_
- A _contraction_ of $(1,1)$ tensor $V^\mu X_\nu$ is a _scalar_

### Expansion of a tensor
- The _components_ of a tensor:
$${T^{\mu_1\dots \mu_k}}_{\nu_1\dots \nu_l}=T(dx^{\mu_1},\dots dx^{\mu_k},\partial_{\nu_1},\dots\partial_{\nu_l})$$
- This can be expressed using the _outer product_:
$$T=\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}(\partial_{\mu_1}\otimes\dots\otimes\partial_{\mu_k}, dx^{\nu_1}\otimes\dots\otimes dx^{\nu_l})$$

## Symmetry and antisymmetry
- A type $(0,2)$ tensor $S_{\mu\nu}$ is _symmetric if_ $S_{\mu\nu}=S_{\nu\mu}$
- It is _antisymmetric_ if $S_{\mu\nu}=-S_{\nu\mu}$

- One can _decompose_ any second-rank tensor into _symmetric and anti-symmetric parts_:
$$S_{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}+S_{\nu\mu})+\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}-S_{\nu\mu})$$
- One can denote the _symmetric and anti-symmetric parts_ by:
$$S_{(\mu\nu)}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}+S_{\nu\mu}) \hspace{1.5cm} S_{[\mu\nu]}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\mu\nu}-S_{\nu\mu})$$
- One can then _generalise_ this to an $n-$th rank tensor:
$$\displaylines{S_{(\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n)}=\frac{1}{n!}(S_{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n}+S_{\mu_2\mu_1\dots\mu_n}+\dots) \\ S_{[\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n]}=\frac{1}{n!}(S_{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_n}-S_{\mu_2\mu_1\dots\mu_n}+\dots)}$$
- The first sum is over _all possible permutations_
- The second sum is an _alternating sum_, with a _negative sign for odd permutations_
- $1/n!$ is a _normalising factor_ such that for a _totally symmetric matrix_, $S_{(\mu_1\mu_2\dots)}=S_{\mu_1\mu_2\dots}$

- One can also _symmetrise over a subset of indices_:
$$S_{(\lambda\mu)\nu}=\frac{1}{2}(S_{\lambda\mu\nu}+S_{\mu\lambda\nu})$$
- Symmetrisation can only take place _among only covariant or contravariant indices_
- The symmetry of the tensor is _independent of coordinate basis_

## Quotient theorem
- _Not all_ sets of quantities labelled with indices are _necessarily tensor components_
- Tensors must satisfy some _quotient relation_

- If a set of quantities, when _contracted_ with an _arbitrary tensor_ produces _another tensor_, the _original set must form the components of a tensor_
- Example: a set of quantities $\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}$, contracted with vector $V^\alpha$:
$$\displaylines{\tenscom{T'}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}v'^\nu=\pd{x^{\lambda'}}{x^\lambda}\pd{x_{\mu'}}{x_\mu}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}V^{\nu}=\pd{x^{\lambda'}}{x^\lambda}\pd{x_{\mu'}}{x_\mu}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}\left(V^{\nu'}\pd{x^\nu}{x^{\nu'}}\right) \\ \tenscom{T'}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}=\pd{x^{\lambda'}}{x^\lambda}\pd{x_{\mu'}}{x_\mu}\pd{x_{\nu'}}{x_\nu}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}}$$
## The metric tensor revisited
- From the above, it is clear that the _metric tensor_ is type $(0,2)$
- Hence it is a _bilinear map_ from a _pair of vectors_ to a _real number_
- One can then use it to define an _inner product_ between vectors:
$$g(a,b)=g_{\mu\nu}a^\mu b^\nu$$

### Index kung-fu and the inverse
- It can also be used to _map vectors to co-vectors_:
$$V_\mu\equiv g_{\mu\nu}V^\nu$$
- This is known as _lowering the index_
- One can also change the _type of a tensor_:
$$T_{\mu\nu}=g_{\mu\lambda}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\nu}$$

- One can define an _inverse metric_:
$$(g^{-1})^{\lambda\mu}g_{\mu\nu}=\delta^\lambda_\nu$$
- One can prove that this _obeys tensor transformation laws_
- It is often simply denoted $g^{\lambda\mu}$
- This is consistent with _index lowering_:
$$g_{\mu\rho}g_{\nu\sigma}g^{\rho\sigma}=g_{\rho\mu}\tenscom{\delta}{\rho}{\nu}=g_{\mu\nu}$$

- In other words, the _inverse metric_ is used to _map co-vectors to vectors_:
$$V^\mu\equiv g^{\mu\nu}V_\nu$$
- This is known as _raising the index_

- By applying the metric, then its _inverse_, one recovers the _original object_

- One can raise and lower indices on general tensors:
$$\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu}{\nu}=T_{\rho\sigma\nu}g^{\rho\lambda}g^{\sigma\mu}=T^{\lambda\mu\rho}g_{\rho\nu}$$

- If one _raises only one index of the metric_, one gets:
$$\tenscom{g}{\mu}{\nu}=\delta^\mu_\nu$$
- This follows from the _definition of the inverse metric_ $g^{\mu\lambda}g_{\lambda\nu}=\delta^\mu_\nu$
- One can show that _its components are the same in any coordinate system_

## The inner product
- Using the definitions above, one can rewrite the _inner product_:
$$g_{\mu\nu}a^\mu b^\nu=g^{\mu\nu}a_\mu b_\nu=a_\nu b^\nu=a^\nu b_\nu$$
- On a _Riemannian manifold_, the $a^\nu a_\nu\geq0$, with _equality iff $a$_ is the _null vector_
- On a _pseudo-Riemannian manifold_, $a^\nu b_\nu$ can be _zero or negative_

- One can define a _generalised length_ of a vector as:
$$|v|=|g_{\mu\nu}V^\mu V^\nu|^{1/2}$$
- One can also define a _generalised angle_ $\theta$:
$$\cos\theta=\frac{a_\mu b^\nu}{|a||b|}$$
- On a _pseudo-Riemannian manifold_, $|\cos\theta|>1$ is _possible_

- If $\cos\theta$ _vanishes_, then the vectors are _orthogonal_

# Vector and tensor calculus on manifolds
- On a _manifold_, as vectors and tensors inhibit _different tangent spaces_, there is _no unique way_ to _compare_ vectors/tensors at different points

- For a _scalar field_, its _gradient_ $\partial\phi/\partial x^\mu$ is a [[#Covariant/dual vectors|covector]]
	- It can be made into a vector by _raising the index_
	- It _maps_ some vector displacement $dx^\nu$ into an _infinitesimal change in the scalar_

## Covariant derivatives and the connection
- In _Euclidean space_, the _derivatives_ of tensor components are with respect to _global Cartesian coordinates_
- It _preserves_ the tensorial nature of the object (_transforming_ in the same way)

- One can see that when applying the "typical" formula for a _gradient of a vector_
$$\pd{V^{\mu'}}{x^{\nu'}}=\pd{x^\lambda}{x^{\nu'}}\pd{}{x^\lambda}\left(V^\mu\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\mu}\right)=\pd{x^\lambda}{x^{\nu'}}\pd{x^{\mu'}}{x^\mu}\pd{V^\mu}{x^\lambda}+\pd{x^\lambda}{x^{\nu'}}\pd{^2x^{\mu'}}{x^\lambda x^\mu}V^\mu$$
- The _first term_ is the transformation for a type $(1,1)$ tensor, but the _latter term_ is extra
- Hence, this object is _not a tensor_

### Covariant derivative of a vector
- One must create a _covariant derivative_ with the properties:
	- For a type $(k,l)$ tensor $\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}$, the covariant derivative $\nabla_\lambda \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_l}$ must be a _type_ $(k,l+1)$ tensor
	- When acting on a _scalar field_ $\phi$, it must create the _gradient_ of that field $\partial\phi/\partial x^\mu$
	- _Linearity_: for tensors of the same type $T$ and $S$, and _constants_ $\alpha$ and $\beta$:
	$$\nabla_\mu(\alpha T+\beta S)=\alpha\nabla_\mu T+\beta\nabla_\mu S$$
	- The _product rule_:
	$$\nabla_\mu(T\otimes S)=(\nabla_\mu T)\otimes S+T\otimes(\nabla_\mu S)$$

- To eliminate the extra term, let the _covariant derivative_ be _defined_:
$$\nabla_\mu V^\nu=\partial_\mu V^\nu+\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}V^{\lambda}$$
- The coefficients are _components_ of a _set of $n$ matrices_ $\tenscom{(\Gamma_\mu)}{\nu}{\lambda}$
	- One matrix for each _direction_ $\mu$
	- For an $n-$dimensional manifold, there are $n^3$ "components"
- They are the _connection coefficients_
	- They _connect_ different areas of the manifold
- From _transforming_ both sides of the equation, one sees that $\tenscom{(\Gamma_\mu)}{\nu}{\lambda}$ is _not a tensor_
	- Purposeful, as the _extra terms_ make sure the transformation is valid
$$\Gamma^{\nu'}_{\mu'\lambda'}=\pd{x^{\nu'}}{x^\nu}\pd{x^{\mu}}{x^{\mu'}} \pd{x^{\lambda}}{x^{\lambda'}}\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}+\pd{x^\mu}{x^{\mu'}}\pd{x^\lambda}{x^{\lambda'}}\pd{^2x^{\nu'}}{x^\mu\partial x^\lambda}$$
- One can also see that the tensor is _not unique_ as it only has to satisfy the above
	- The _difference_ of two connections $\Gamma$ and $\tilde{\Gamma}$, their _difference_ transforms as a type $(1,2)$ tensor
	- Hence, it is _unique up to_ a type $(1,2)$ tensor

### Generalising the covariant derivative
- For _covectors_, there may be a _different connection_:
$$\nabla_\mu\omega_\nu=\partial_\mu\omega_\nu+\tilde{\Gamma}^\lambda_{\mu\nu}\omega_\lambda$$

- Then one must define a covariant derivative with _two new properties_:
	- It must _commute with contractions_:
	$$\nabla_\mu \tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\lambda\rho}=\tenscom{(\nabla T)_\mu}{\;\lambda}{\lambda\rho}$$
	- For a _scalar_, it reduces to the _partial derivative_:
	$$\nabla_\mu\phi=\partial_\mu\phi$$
- The first is equivalent to requiring $\nabla_\mu\delta^\lambda_\rho=0$ (The _Kronecker Delta_ is _covariantly constant_)

- By considering the covariant derivative of a _scalar_ $\nabla_\mu(\omega_\lambda V^\lambda)$:
$$\displaylines{\tilde{\Gamma}^\nu_{\mu\lambda}=-\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda} \\ \nabla_\mu\omega_\lambda=\partial_\mu\omega_\lambda-\Gamma^\nu_{\mu\lambda}\omega_\nu}$$

- Then, the _general expression_ for the connection can be built up:
$$\begin{aligned}\nabla_\sigma \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l}&=\partial_\sigma \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l} \\ &+\Gamma^{\mu_1}_{\sigma\lambda}\tenscom{T}{\lambda\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l} + \Gamma^{\mu_2}_{\sigma\lambda}\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\lambda\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l}+\dots \\ &-\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_1}\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\lambda\nu_2\dots\nu_l} - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\sigma\nu_2}\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\lambda\dots\nu_l}-\dots\end{aligned}$$
- Convenient _notation_:
$$\nabla_\sigma \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l}\equiv \tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l;\sigma}$$

### The torsion tensor
- From the discussion above, consider the fact that _any connection_ can be written as a _combination_ of some _fiducial connection_ with a _type $(1,2)$ tensor_:
$$\Gamma^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}=\hat{\Gamma}^\lambda_{\mu\nu}+\tenscom{S}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}$$
- Then consider the fact that by _permuting lower indices_, one can form _another connection_ (as the non-tensorial term has _commut-able partial derivatives_)

- Then define the _torsion tensor_:
$$\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}=\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}-\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\mu}=2\Gamma^\lambda_{[\mu\nu]}$$
- It is clearly _antisymmetric_
## The metric connection
- Define a _unique connection_, on a manifold with _metric_ $g_{\mu\nu}$
	- Let it be _torsion-free_: $$\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}=\Gamma^\lambda_{(\mu\nu)}$$
	- Let it be _metric compatible_:
	$$\nabla_\rho g_{\mu\nu}=0$$
- From this, one also gets that the _inverse metric is covariantly constant_
- Metric compatibility also means the _covariant derivative commutes with index raising/lowering_:
$$g_{\mu\lambda}\nabla_\rho V^\lambda=\nabla_\rho(g_{\mu\lambda}V^\lambda)=\nabla_\rho V_\mu$$

- By considering the _cyclic permutations_ of the metric compatibility, and subtracting two of the equations from the third, one can _solve for the metric connection_:
$$\displaylines{\partial_\rho g_{\mu\nu}=\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\mu} g_{\lambda\nu}+\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\nu}g_{\mu\lambda}\\\Gamma^\sigma_{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}g^{\sigma\rho}(\partial_\mu g_{\nu\rho}+\partial_\nu g_{\rho\mu}-\partial_\rho g_{\mu\nu})}$$
- These are also called _Christoffel symbols_

- From the first equation above:
$$g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\rho g_{\mu\nu}=2\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\lambda}$$
- Using _Jacobi's formula_ $|\dunderline{M}|^{-1}\partial_\rho|\dunderline{M}|=\text{Tr}(\dunderline{M}^{-1}\partial_\rho\dunderline{M})$:
$$\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\lambda}=\frac{1}{2}g^{-1}\partial_\rho g=\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_\rho \sqrt{|g|}$$
### For local Cartesian coordinates
- For _any metric_, one can make it [[#Local Cartesian Coordinates on Riemannian manifolds|locally Cartesian]]
- As the _derivatives vanish_, one gets that _the metric connection vanishes_
- In this case, the _covariant derivative reduces to partial differentiation_

### The divergence, curl, and Laplacian
- One can define a _covariant divergence_:
$$\nabla_\mu V^\mu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_\lambda\left(\sqrt{|g|}V^\lambda\right)$$
- The _curl_ of some _dual vector field_ $X$ is defined as the _antisymmetric part_ of the covariant derivative:
$$(\text{curl }X)_{\mu\nu}=\nabla_\mu X_\nu-\nabla_\nu X_\mu=\partial_\mu X_\nu-\partial_\nu X_\mu$$
- One can prove that this is _independent of connection_
- The _curl of a gradient vanishes_ 

- The _Laplacian operator_ is then:
$$\nabla^2\phi=\nabla_\mu(g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\nu\phi)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}}\partial_\mu(\sqrt{g}\,g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\nu\phi)$$
## The intrinsic derivative along a curve
- One often needs to take _derivatives of vectors along a curve_
- Consider some vector $V(u)$ along some _curve_ $x^\mu(u)$

- The _intrinsic derivative_ of the vector along the curve is then:
$$\frac{DV^\mu}{Du}\equiv\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\nabla_\nu V^\mu=\frac{dx^\nu}{du}(\partial_\nu V^\mu+\Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda}V^\lambda)$$
- Contracting the first term:
$$\frac{DV^\mu}{Du}=\frac{dV^\mu}{du}+\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\Gamma^\mu_{\nu\lambda}V^\lambda$$
- The _first term_ is the _ordinary derivative_, which _does not transform as a vector_
- Therefore, one needs the _connection term_

- This can be extended to _tensors_
- Example: type $(1,1)$
$$\frac{D\tenscom{T}{\mu}{\nu}}{Du}=\frac{d\tenscom{T}{\mu}{\nu}}{du}+\frac{dx^\rho}{du}(\Gamma^\mu_{\rho\lambda}\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\nu}-\Gamma^\lambda_{\rho\nu}\tenscom{T}{\mu}{\lambda})$$
## Parallel transport
- The _covariant derivative_ will _compare_ the vectors/tensors at different points after they are _parallel transported_ to the same point
- _Parallel transportation_ keeps the vector/tensor _constant_, while moving it _along a curve_
![[Parallel transport.png]]
- In _Euclidean space_, this is given by $dV^\mu/du=0$
- On a _manifold_, parallel transport of a vector $V^\mu$ is given by:
$$\frac{DV^\mu}{Du}=0$$
- This also applies to _tensors_:
$$\frac{D\tenscom{T}{\mu_1\mu_2\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\nu_2\dots\nu_l}}{Du}=0$$
- One can see that the parallel transport is _dependent on the path taken_
	- The vectors live in _different tangent spaces_
![[Parallel transport sphere.png|400]]
- One can check that for a _given path_, transport is _independent of parametrisation_
- One can also check that $D|V|^2/Du=0$ for parallel transport

- Parallel transport is also _dependent on connection_
- If the connection is _metric compatible_, the metric is _parallel transported_
- One can then check that the _inner product of two parallel transported vectors_ is _conserved_

## Geodesics, proper time, and affine parameters
- A geodesic is an _extremal path_ between two points on a manifold
	- A _generalisation_ of straight lines
- They can also be defined as curves that _parallel transport vectors_

- The condition of _parallel transporting the tangent vector_:
$$\displaylines{\frac{Dt^\mu}{Du}=\frac{D}{Du}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}=0 \\ \frac{d^2x^\mu}{du^2}+\Gamma^\mu_{\rho\sigma}\frac{dx^\rho}{du}\frac{dx^\sigma}{du}=0}$$
- This is the _geodesic equation_

### Proper time and affine parameters
- Geodesics are also paths of _maximum proper time_
	- For _any timelike path_, one can construct a similar _null_ path with _zero path length_
	- Therefore, the _extremised proper time_ must be a _maximum_
- One can then _extremise_ the proper time:
$$\tau=\int\left|g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{du}\frac{dx^\nu}{du}\right|^{1/2}\,du$$
- Add some _variation_ $\delta\tau$, with $f=g_{\mu\nu}(dx^\mu/du)(dx^\nu/du)$:
$$\delta\tau=\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}\delta f\,du$$
- Specify $\tau$ as the _parameter_ of the variation, such that the _tangent vector_ is the [[Special Relativity#Particle kinetics in index notation|4-velocity]] $U^\mu$, and $f=1$
- For _stationary proper time_, one must _extremise_ the integral:
$$I=\frac{1}{2}\int f\,d\tau$$
- By adding some _variation_ in $\delta x^\mu$, and _integrating by parts_, one recovers the _geodesic equation_ as:
$$\displaylines{x^\mu\to x^\mu+\delta x^\mu \\ g_{\mu\nu}\to g_{\mu\nu}+(\partial_\sigma g_{\mu\nu})\delta x^\sigma \\ \frac{d^2x^\mu}{d\tau^2}+\Gamma^\mu_{\rho\sigma}\frac{dx^\rho}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\sigma}{d\tau}=0}$$
- Therefore, the geodesic equation can be _parametrised by proper time_
- In fact, it can be parametrised with _any parameter_ $\lambda$ that _satisfies_:
$$\tau\to\lambda=a\tau+b$$
- $\lambda$ is then known as an _affine parameter_

- For a _timelike path_, the geodesic equation in terms of the _4-velocity_ and _4-momentum_:
$$U^\lambda\nabla_\lambda U^\mu=0 \hspace{1.5cm} p^\lambda\nabla_\lambda p^\mu=0$$
- For a _null path_, $\tau$ is _not a proper affine parameter_
	- If it is a geodesic for _some parameter_ $\lambda$, then $a\lambda+b$ is also an affine parameter

- In the derivation above, $f$ is the _Lagrangian_ of the variation:
$$\Lagr=g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau}$$
- By writing out the _Euler-Lagrange equation_ explicitly, and _lowering indices_, one can get an _alternative form_ of the geodesic equation:
$$\frac{d^2x_\mu}{d\tau^2}=\frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu g_{\nu\lambda}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\lambda}{d\tau}$$
### Particle kinetics and conserved quantities on a geodesic
- A _freely-falling_ test particle (which _does not influence the geometry through which it moves_), will always _move along a geodesic_
- It always _moves along the direction in which the 4-momentum is pointing_
	- Reflected in $p^\lambda\nabla_\lambda p^\mu=0$

- A geodesic is also a path of _maximum proper time_
	- It has _maximum proper time locally_
	- Example: in the _twin paradox_, the stationary twin is _on a geodesic_

- _Given_ some vector at a point, then _solving for subsequent motion on a geodesic_, one generates a _unique geodesic_, which is _everywhere timelike/null/spacelike_
	- Parallel transport _preserves_ the interval

- The _conservation_ of the interval follows from the fact that the _Lagrangian_ is _not explicitly dependent_ on the affine parameter

- One can also see that if:
$$\partial_\mu g_{\nu\lambda}=0\Longrightarrow \frac{dx_\mu}{d\tau}=\text{const.}$$
- If the metric is _independent of some coordinate direction_ $x^\mu$, the $x^\mu$ component of the _tangent vector_ must be _conserved_
- It is effectively the _conjugate momentum_

# Curvature
- One characterises curvature using the _Riemann curvature tensor_
- On a _flat space_:
	- Parallel transport round a _loop_ leaves a vector _unchanged_
	- _Covariant derivatives_ will _commute_
	- Geodesics that are _initially parallel_ will _remain parallel_

- On a curved space, the _change_ in a vector around a closed loop is related to _total curvature enclosed_
- Then for _local curvature_, let there be an _infinitesimal loop_

- For vector $V^\rho$, around a loop with vectors $A^\mu$ and $B^\nu$, the _change in the vector_ should be _proportional_ to components $V^\sigma$, as well as $A^\mu$ and $B^\nu$
- Therefore, define the _Riemann curvature tensor_:
$$\delta V^\rho=\tenscom{R}{\rho}{\sigma\mu\nu}V^\sigma A^\mu B^\nu$$
- _Swapping_ the vectors results in a loop in the opposite direction, hence:
$$\tenscom{R}{\rho}{\sigma\mu\nu}=-\tenscom{R}{\rho}{\sigma\nu\mu}$$
- For an infinitesimal loop, take the _commutator_ of two _covariant derivatives_:
$$[\nabla_\mu,\nabla_\nu]V^\rho=\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu V^\rho-\nabla_\nu\nabla_\mu V^\rho$$
- Expanding out all of the terms:
$$[\nabla_\mu,\nabla_\nu]V^\rho=(\partial_\mu\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma}-\nabla_\nu\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\sigma}+\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\sigma}-\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\sigma})V^\sigma-\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}\nabla_\lambda V^\rho$$
- Here, $\tenscom{T}{\lambda}{\mu\nu}$ is the _torsion tensor_, equal to $2\Gamma^\lambda_{[\mu\nu]}$
- This is true for _any connection_

- So, one can identify the _Riemann curvature tensor_:
$$\tenscom{R}{\rho}{\mu\nu\sigma}=\partial_\mu\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\sigma}-\partial_\nu\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\sigma}+\Gamma^\rho_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\nu\sigma}-\Gamma^\rho_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\sigma}$$
- From this, the action of the commutator can be calculated for a _tensor of any rank_:
$$[\nabla_\rho,\nabla_\sigma]\tenscom{X}{\mu_1\dots\mu_k}{\nu_1\dots\nu_k}$$
