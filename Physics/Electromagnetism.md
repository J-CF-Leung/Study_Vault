## Vector calculus theorems
- [[Vector calculus in 3-dimensions]]

### Stokes' Theorem
$$\oint_{\partial S}d\bm{l}\cdot \bm{A}(\bm{r})=\int_S d\bm{S}\cdot \left[\nabla \times \bm{A}(\bm{r})\right]$$
### Divergence Theorem
$$\oint_{S=\partial V}d\bm{S}\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})=\int_VdV\,\nabla\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})$$


## Preview: Maxwell's equations
### Variables
- Vector fields:
	- Electric field $\bm{E}$
	- Magnetic flux density $\bm{B}$
	- Electric displacement $\bm{D}$
	- Magnetic field $\bm{H}$
	- Current density $\bm{J}$
- Scalar fields:
	- Charge density $\rho$


### In a vacuum
- Differential forms given, integral forms obtained using the Divergence/Stokes Theorems
$$\begin{aligned}\nabla\cdot\bm{E}&=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\ \nabla\times\bm{E}&=-\pd{\bm{B}}{t} \\ \nabla\cdot\bm{B}&=0 \\ \nabla\times\bm{B}&=\mu_0\bm{J}+\mu_0\epsilon_0\pd{\bm{E}}{t} \end{aligned}$$
- Lorentz force law:
$$\bm{F}=q(\bm{E}+\bm{v}\cdot\bm{B})$$
- The continuity of charge:
$$\pd{\rho}{t}+\nabla\cdot\bm{J}=0$$


### In matter
- These forms are _independent of material_
$$\begin{aligned}\nabla\cdot\bm{D}&=\rho_{free} \\ \nabla\times\bm{H} &= \bm{J}_{free}+\pd{\bm{D}}{t}\end{aligned}$$


## Electrostatics
### The electrostatic force and field
- _Coulomb's law_ between 2 point charges
 $$\bm{F}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\bm{\hat{r}}$$
- Define a vector field $\bm{E}$ caused by some charge, which causea a force $\bm{F}$ on an infinitesimally small test charge $q$:
$$\bm{F}=q\bm{E}(\bm{r})$$
- The _electric field_ of a charge $q$:
$$\bm{E}(\bm{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\bm{\hat{r}}$$

- The superposition principle: electric fields from several charged particles are (vectorially) additive â€” electrostatics is linear (in a vacuum)

### The electrostatic potential
- The work done to move a charge from $\bm{r}$ to $\bm{r+}d\bm{r}$:
 $$dW=-d\bm{r}\cdot\bm{F}(\bm{r})$$
	 - The work is oone _against_ the force $\bm{F}$
- The electrostatic potential difference:
$$dV=-d\bm{r}\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})$$
- The potential difference $V$ between 2 points is the _work required per unit charge_ to move an _infinitesimally small unit charge_ between the 2 points
- The point of zero potential is chosen arbitrarily, often infinity
- The potential difference from $A$ to $B$:
$$V_{BA}=-\int_A^Bd\bm{r}\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})$$
- The electrostatic potential $V(\bm{r})$ is a scalar field

- $V(\bm{r})$ is a _path-independent_ field (only the end-points matter) _for an electrostatic system_
	- Consider moving a charge from $A$, to $B$, then back to $A$

- From the definitions of the gradient and $V$:
$$\bm{E}(\bm{r})=-\nabla V(\bm{r})$$
- The physical interpretation of $V$:
	- The electric field $\bm{E}$ points in the direction where $V$ _decreases most rapidly_
	- $|\nabla V(\bm{r})|$ is the maximum rate of change

- $V$ is defined to within a spatially constant offset, as only $\bm{E}$ is physically observable
- The undefined constant is the _gauge_, to make time-varying fields mathematically simpler

- Often simpler to find add potentials using superposition, then use grad to find $\bm{E}$

### The spatial derivatives of an electrostatic field
- Use the fact that the p.d. around a loop is zero
- Consider moving a charge through a loop in a plane, in an _electrostatic system_:
$$\pd{E_i}{x_j}=\pd{E_j}{x_i}$$
- This can be expressed using the curl, and Stokes' theorem:
$$\nabla\times\bm{E}=0$$
### Monopoles
- A monopole is defined as a _single point charge_ $q$
- Using the definition of $V$, its electrostatic potential is:
$$V(\bm{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r}$$
- Its electric field can be rederived from the potential
	- As the system is spherically symmetric, the field is radial and independent of $\theta$ or $\phi$

- A charge can be regarded as a "source" of field lines

### Dipoles
- A dipole is defined as two point charges $+q$ and $-q$ placed at a _short distance_ $a$ apart
	- No overall net charge
	- _Direction_ of the dipole is from $-q$ to $+q$

- Due to the separation, $\bm{E\neq0}$
- Using the superposition principle for potentials, for $r>>a$:
 $$V(r,\theta)=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{qa\cos\theta}{r^2}$$
	- Falls off _quicker than the monopole_ 
- Define the _dipole moment_ $p\equiv qa$:
$$V(\bm{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\bm{p\cdot r}}{r^3}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\bm{p\cdot\hat{r}}}{r^2}$$
- The electric field is:
 $$\bm{E}(\bm{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{p}{r^3}\left[\bm{\hat{r}}\, 2\cos\theta+\bm{\hat{\theta}}\,\sin\theta\right]=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{p}{r^3}\left[3(\bm{p\cdot \hat{r}})\bm{\hat{r}} -\bm{p}\right]$$
	- As expected, falls off quicker than the monopole
	- As separation decreases, $|\bm{E}|$ tends to zero as expected
	- At $\theta=0$, the field is radial
	- At $\theta=\pi/2$, the field is azimuthal

#### A dipole in a uniform electric field
- The _force and couple_ on a dipole in a uniform field:
	- The charges experience the _same force in opposite directions_
	- The dipole actually experiences a _couple_:
	$$\bm{G=p\times E}$$
	- The couple is zero when the dipole is aligned with the field
	- Equilibrium is alignment

- The _potential energy_ of a dipole in a uniform field:
	- No work needs to be done for displacement
	- Consider work done to _increase the angle_ by $d\theta$
	- Taking $\theta=\pi/2$ as the reference:
	$$U=-\bm{p\cdot E}$$
	- Negative when dipole is more aligned
	- Stable equilibrium when $\theta=0$, unstable equilibrium when $\theta=\pi$


#### A dipole in a non-uniform electric field
 - The force on the dipole:
	 - The electric field at the positive charge can be written as:
	 $$\bm{E^+}=\bm{E^-}+\bm{a\cdot}(\nabla \bm{E})$$
	 - The force on the dipole is:
	 $$F=(\bm{p \cdot \nabla})\bm{E}$$
		 - For a constant dipole moment, $F=\nabla[\bm{p\cdot E}]$
		- It can be written as $F=-\nabla U$
		- $U$ is _rotational_ potential energy
	- For a _fixed, rigid_ (i.e. non-induced) dipole, the dipole will move to a position where it is aligned with the field
	- This calculation assumes the dipole _will not rotate_

### The multipole expansion
- _Expand_ the potential of any charge distribution 
- Monopole - net charge, $V \propto 1/r$
- Dipole: No net charge, net dipole moment, $V\propto 1/r^2$
- Quadrupole: 2 dipoles pointing in opposite directions, $V\propto 1/r^3$

- For any general distribution, many terms will be present simultaneously
- Definition of monopole:
$$Q=\int\,dV\,\rho(\bm{r})$$
- Definition of dipole:
$$\bm{p}=\int\,dV\bm{r}\,\rho(\bm{r})$$
- Quadrupole: tensor

- Any potential can be expeanded with a linear combination of terms

- More mathematical details: [[Topics in Electromagnetism#Multipole expansion|Multipole expansion]]

### Electric flux and Gauss' Law for electrostatics
- Quantify "field line density" using the concept of _electric flux_:
$$\int_S d\bm{S}\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})$$
	- Not exactly a "measurable" quantity

- _Charge conservation and continuity_: consider a _current density_ $\bm{J}$ through a closed surface
$$I=\oint_Sd\bm{S}\cdot\bm{J}=-\pd{}{t}\int\,dV\,\rho=\int_V\,dV \,\nabla\cdot\bm{J}$$
- _Continuity_ equation:
$$\pd{\rho}{t}+\nabla\cdot\bm{J}=0$$

- Consider the flux through a closed surface enclosing a _single_ charge:
$$\int_Sd\bm{S}\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})=\frac{q}{\epsilon_0}$$
- _Does not matter where_ the charge is within the surface
- Shape can be _arbitrary_

- Assume a continuous charge distribution, and use superposition
- The integral form of the _Gauss Law for Electrostatics_:
$$\oint_{S=\partial V}d\bm{S}\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})=\frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \int_VdV\,\rho(\bm{r})$$
- The differential form:
$$\nabla\cdot\bm{E}=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$

- The electric _displacement_/electric flux density:
$$\bm{D}(\bm{r})=\epsilon_0\bm{E}(\bm{r})$$
$$\oint_{S=\partial V}d\bm{S}\cdot\bm{D}(\bm{r})=\int_VdV\,\rho(\bm{r})$$
$$\nabla\cdot\bm{D}=\rho$$

### Applying Gauss's Law to charge distributions
- An _infinite, uniform sheet_ of charge: draw a _Gaussian pillbox_
$$\bm{E}=\frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\bm{\hat{n}}$$
	- Infinite size leads to symmetry and a normal electric field
	- Capacitor: 2 parallel sheets of opposite sign, $\bm{E}=\sigma/\epsilon_0\bm{\hat{n}}$

- An _infinite, uniform line_ of charge: draw a _Gaussian cylinder_
$$\bm{E}=\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\epsilon_0r}\bm{\hat{r}}$$
	- Potential between points at distances $r$ and $r_0$: $V=\lambda/(2\pi\epsilon_0)\ln(r/r_0)$
	- Coaxial cable: two cylinders

### Laplace's and Poisson's equations
- Consider the field at a point, expressed using the potential
- Poisson's equation:
$$-\nabla\cdot\bm{E}=\nabla\cdot(\nabla V)=\nabla^2V=-\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
- Laplace operator: measure of curvature (relates curvature to charge density)

- Special case: _charge-free_ region
- Here, one gets Laplace's equation:
$$\nabla^2V=0$$
- [[Poisson and Laplace's equations|How to solve the damn things]]


### Capacitance
- Consider two conducting surfaces with potential difference $V$, holding opposite amounts of charge $Q$, the capacitance $C$ is:
$$C=\frac{Q}{V}$$
- Reference point can be anywhere on the two surfaces

### Electrostatic energy

#### Assembly of charges
- Assemble a system of point charges $q_i$ from infinity
- Adding up the energy from assembling each individual charge:
$$U_N=\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{i<j}\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_jq_i}{r_{ij}}$$

- Modifying the sum:
$$U_N=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^Nq_j\sum_{i\neq j}\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_i}{r_{ij}}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{j=1}^Nq_jV_j$$
	- $V_j$: potential of all charges _except $q_j$_

- For a continuous distribution of charge: $q_i\rightarrow \rho \,d^3\bm{r}$
$$U=\frac{1}{2}\int d^3\bm{r}\,\rho(\bm{r})\,V(\bm{r})$$
	- $V(\bm{r})$ still does not involve the infinitesimal charge element at $\bm{r}$

#### Energy in a capacitor
- Sum over $N$ infinitesimal charges $dQ$ so $Q=NdQ$:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}\frac{Q^2}{C}=\frac{1}{2}QV=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$

#### Energy stored in the electric field
- Energy can be considered to be stored in the field itself

- By considering a parallel plate capacitor, with area $A$ and distance $d$:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}QV=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0|\bm{E}|^2\,(Ad)$$

- This gives an _energy density_ $U_E$:
$$U\equiv\int\,d^3\bm{r}\;U_E(\bm{r})=\int d^3\bm{r}\,\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0 |\bm{E}(\bm{r})|^2$$

- Considering electric displacement:
$$U=\int d^3\bm{r}\,\bm{D}(\bm{r})\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})$$
- _Also valid for dielectrics_

- For _any_ arbitrary charge distribution, over any arbitrary surface:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\left[\int d^3\bm{r}\,|\bm{E}(\bm{r})|^2+\int d\bm{S}\cdot[V(\bm{r})\bm{E}(\bm{r})]\right]$$
- The integral must be taken _at infinity_ for the second term to vanish

#### Some nuance
- When dealing with point charges, $\sum \frac{1}{2}qV$ is the energy required to _assemble_ the charges
	- Here, $V$ does not include the potential of the charge itself (since it blows up)
- When dealing with a continuous distribution, $\frac{1}{2}\int \rho V  \,d^3\bm{r}$ is the energy of the _entire system_
	- Here, $V$ is the _full potential_ as the infinitesimal charge has a negligible contribution
- The energy of the whole system is also calculated by $\frac{1}{2} \int \epsilon_0|\bm{E}|^2\,d^3\bm{r}$ over all space
	- One may find that from this, the energy of a point charge is _infinite_

- Conclusion: for point charges, sum; for continuous distributions, integrate

- In the context of electrostatics, the energy is not "stored" anywhere
- In radiation theory and relatvity, the energy is stored _in the field_

>[!quote]
The infinite energy of a point charge is a recurring source of embarrassment for electromagnetic theory, afflicting the quantum version as well as the classical.
>-David J. Griffiths

### Virtual work in electrostatics
- Write down the energy as a function of a displacement of something in the system
	- Account for work done by an external mechanical system
	- Account for energy dissipated or supplied by external circuit components
- Work done on a system to change a distance from $x$ to $x+dx$ is:
$$F\,dx=\pd{U_s}{x}\,dx+\pd{U_d}{x}\,dx$$
	- $U_s$: energy stored in system
	- $U_d$: energy dissipated from system

- Example: force between two _isolated_ (constant charge) ppositely charged parallel plates
	- No energy dissipated, stored energy increases
	- Constant force _independent of distance_, proportional to plate area
	- Can also be calculated by considering charge on one plate experiencing the field of the other

- Example: force between capacitor plates with _constant voltage_ $V$
	- As $x$ increases, $E$ falls due to constant $V$ --> charge falls as current flows between the plates _through a battery_
	- Stored energy _decreases_ with increasing $x$
	- Energy is _dissipated_ as charge moves to the other plate ($dQ<0, dE_d=-VdQ$)
	- Force is proportional to $1/x^2$, still proportional to plate area


### Homogeneous Dielectrics
- Previously: free space and conductors
- Dielectrics: insulating materials
	- No free charge in the material itself, only _bound charges_
	- Overall neutral

- When an external electric field is applied, positive and negative _bound charges separate_, and a dipole moment is induced
- For uniform $\bm{E}_0$ and a homogeneous material, charge only appears on external surfaces
	- Charges inside are _cancelled out_ (they don't move to the surface!)

- _Linear dielectrics_: induced dipole moment is linearly proportional to $\bm{E}_0$
	- Non-linear behaviour emerges for high $\bm{E}_0$
- _Isotropic materials_: magnitude of induced dipole moment is independent of orientation of $\bm{E}_0$ relative to the material

- _Polarisation_ $\bm{P}$: dipole moment _per unit volume_
	$$\bm{P}=\frac{d\bm{p}}{dV}$$
	- Independent of material size and shape

- Consider an infinitesimal cubic volume of polarised dielectric material
- When putting microscopic volumes together in a _uniform_ $\bm{E}_0$, _surface charges cancel_
- Surface bound charge density:
$$\sigma=\bm{P\cdot\hat{n}}$$

- Putting a linear dielectric in a capacitor
	- _Constant potential_: as bound charges are induced, _free charge increases_ to maintain the electric field
	- _Constant free charge_: due to induced charges, total charge decreases and _potential decreases_

- The total charge on a capacitor plate can be written as:
$$Q=\epsilon_0(1+\chi)|\bm{E}|A$$
	- Two contributions: original without dielectric, and extra to offset bound charge
	- $\chi=$ electrical susceptibility, property of the material that gives surface polarisation

- Define the _relative permittivity_ $\epsilon$:
$$\epsilon=1+\chi$$
- Then, the capacitance becomes:
$$C=\frac{Q_f}{V}=\frac{\epsilon_0\epsilon A}{d}$$

- Consider a non-uniform external field
- $\bm{P}$ is also non-uniform, and not all bound charges in the interior are cancelled out
- Consider microscopic volumes put together, one gets a volume bound charge density:
$$\rho=-\nabla\cdot\bm{P}$$
	- Analagous to free charge being a source of the electric field

- Integrating $\rho$ over the volume of the dielectric and applying the divergence theorem:
$$-\int_\mathcal{V}\nabla\cdot\bm{P}\,d^3\bm{r}=\int_{S= \partial\mathcal{V}}\bm{P}\cdot d\bm{S}$$
	- The interior bound charge is equal and opposite to the surface bound charge

- [[Dielectric and magnetic materials|Applications in materials science]]
#### Gauss' Law in dielectrics
- The total charge density is $\rho_f+\rho_b=\epsilon_0\nabla\cdot \bm{E}$
- Define the _electric displacement_ $\bm{D}$:
$$\bm{D}\equiv\epsilon_0\bm{E}+\bm{P}$$
	- Also known as _electric flux density_
- Gauss' Law for dielectrics:
$$\nabla\cdot\bm{D}=\rho_f$$
- For linear dielectrics, using the definition of relative permittivity:
$$\bm{D}=\epsilon\epsilon_0\bm{E}$$
- If $\epsilon$ is constant, $\rho=\nabla\cdot\bm{E}=\rho_f/(\epsilon\epsilon_0)$
	- Total charge density reduced due to bound charge
- This form of Gauss' Law is independent of material properties

#### Remarks about dielectrics
- The induction of a dipole is an _approximation_
- A charge distribution is described by a _hierarchy of terms_
- The dipole is the lowest order term
- The gradient of $\bm{E}$ induces a quadrupole
- The second spatial derivative induces an octopole

- The electric field $\bm{E}$ is more "fundamental", and is an actual measurable quantity

#### Situations involving dielectrics
- _Constant potential_ between a collection of equipotential surfaces:
	- _$\bm{E}$ is determined_ and fixed
	- $\bm{D}$ gives free charge on the surfaces
	- Free charge is dependent on $\epsilon$ as potential is maintained
- _Constant free charge_ between a collection of equipotential surfaces
	- _$\bm{D}$ is determined_ and fixed
	- $\bm{E}$ and $V$ depend on $\epsilon$ as a dielectric is introduced, to maintain free charge

### Inhomogeneous dielectrics and boundary conditions
- Inhomogeneous dielectric: $\epsilon$ varies with position
- Consider a flat boundary where $\epsilon$ has a _discontinuity, with no free charge_

- Draw a Gaussian pillbox across the boundary
- Since there should be no free charge on the surface:
$$\bm{D}_{\perp1}=\bm{D}_{\perp2}$$
- $\bm{E}_\perp$ _must be discontinuous_ due to the discontinuity in $\epsilon$

- As for the parallel component, using Stokes' Theorem:
$$\bm{E}_{||1}=\bm{E}_{||2}$$
- $\bm{D}_{||}$ _must be discontinuous_

- Due to these discontinuities, field lines for $\bm{D}$ and $\bm{E}$ change direction
- $\bm{E}$ field lines can terminate on surface bound charges
- $\bm{D}$  and $\bm{E}$ field lines are parallel

- The direction, parametrised by an angle $\theta$ to the normal:
$$\frac{\cot\theta_2}{\cot\theta_1}=\frac{\epsilon_1}{\epsilon_2}$$
- The magnitudes of $\bm{P}$ and $\bm{E}$ of a dielectric body in an external field is heavily dependent on shape

- Dielectric sphere in a uniform field:
	- Uniform electric field in sphere
	- Sphere is polarised and acts as a dipole
	- From solving Laplace's equation and applying the appropriate boundary conditions:
$$\bm{E}_\text{in}=\frac{3}{\epsilon+2}\bm{E}_0$$

### Energy density in dielectrics
- The same formula for energy from $\rho$ and $V$ applies:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}\int d^3\bm{r}\,\rho(\bm{r})V(\bm{r})$$
- Following a similar derivation as above:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}\int\,d^3\bm{r}\,\bm{D}(\bm{r})\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})$$
- Interpretation: bringing in free charge, which _induces bound charge_
	- Work done in inducing bound charges accounted for in $V$
- This is only suitable for _LINEAR dielectrics_

- From the approach of bringing in bits of free charge, a change in energy is:
$$dU=\int(\Delta \bm{D})\cdot\bm{E}\;d^3\bm{r}$$

## Magnetostatics
- Just as charges give rise to electric fields, moving charge gives rise to magnetic fields

- Electrostatics: static charges
- Magnetostatics: constantly moving charges, time-invariant current

- For time-invariant systems, electric and magnetic fields are separate
	- No need to deal with [[Relativity]]

### The Lorentz Force and the Biot-Savart Law
- Let there be a test current element $d\bm{l}$, with its direction defining the current flow
- The _magnetic field_ $\bm{B}$ is defined through the force exerted on the test current:
$$d\bm{F}=Id\bm{l}\wedge\bm{B}$$

- The _Lorentz force_ is the force on a moving charge, accounting for both $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{B}$:
$$\bm{F}=q(\bm{E}+\bm{v}\wedge\bm{B})$$

- The _Biot-Savart law_ described the magnetic field _produced_ by a test current:
$$d\bm{B}=\frac{\mu_0I}{4\pi r^2}d\bm{l}\wedge\bm{\hat{r}}$$
	- $\mu_0$: _permeability_ of free space

- The magnetic field also decreases as an inverse square
- The magnetic field lines _circulate around current_
- There are _no point sources_ (magnetic monopoles)

- The total magnetic field:
$$\bm{B}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int d\bm{l}\wedge\bm{\hat{r}}\,\frac{I}{r^2}$$
- The force between two current elements, with displacement $\bm{r}$ from $d\bm{l}_1$ to $d\bm{l}_2$:
$$d\bm{F}_2=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}I_1I_2\,d\bm{l}_2\wedge(d\bm{l}_1 \wedge\frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{r^2})$$
- Maximum when aligned
- Attractive if current flow is in the same direction

### Gauss' Law for magnetic fields
- Like the electric flux, the magnetic flux is given by:
$$\Phi_B=\int_S d\bm{S}\cdot\bm{B}(\bm{r})$$
- This gives the magnetic field $\bm{B}$ another name: the _magnetic flux density_
- Using the properties of the field (no monopoles):
$$\displaylines{\oint_S d\bm{S}\cdot \bm{B}=0\\ \nabla\cdot\bm{B}=0}$$
- This is _Gauss' Law for the magnetic field_

### Magnetic dipoles
- No monopoles: smallest unit is a dipole
- Dipole: infinitesimally small current loop

#### Uniform magnetic field
- Consider an infinitesimal current loop in a uniform magnetic field
- The current loop experienced a couple of forces to produce a torque
- For a large current loop with area elements $d\bm{S}$, the _magnetic dipole moment_ is:
$$\bm{m}=I\int_S d\bm{S}$$
- The couple it experiences is:
$$\bm{G}=\bm{m}\wedge\bm{B}$$

- By considering _work done to rotate the dipole_ by $d\theta$, where $\theta$ is relative to $\bm{B}$:
$$U=-\bm{m}\cdot\bm{B}$$
	- Minimum when aligned with the field
	- For a macroscopic current loop, the energy becomes $-I\Phi$


#### Non-uniform magnetic field
- By considering infinitesimal current loops in the field:
$$\bm{F}=m_j\pd{B_j}{x_i}\bm{e}_i$$
- For a _uniform dipole moment_:
$$\bm{F}(\bm{r})=\nabla[\bm{m}\cdot\bm{B}(\bm{r})]$$
- A _fixed_ dipole tends to move to a position where it can be _aligned with the field_

### The magnetic scalar potential
- Define a _magnetic field strength_ $\bm{H}(\bm{r})$:
$$\bm{B}(\bm{r})=\mu_0\bm{H}(\bm{r})$$
- We would like to describe it in terms of a _magnetic scalar potential_ $\phi_m(\bm{r})$:
$$\displaylines{\bm{H}(\bm{r})=-\nabla\phi_m(\bm{r}) \\ \bm{B}(\bm{r})=-\mu_0\nabla\phi_m(\bm{r})}$$
- As in the case of the electric field, this representation is valid when _the curl is zero_

- The curl is zero _except where there are currents_
- A scalar potential _can be defined for regions far away from currents_

- Physical meaning of $\phi_m$: _unrelated to work_, simply the shape of a landscape to generate $\bm{B}$

#### Magnetic scalar potential of a current loop
- The solid angle $d\Omega$ is defined by an element of surface area $d\bm{S}$ on a sphere of radius $r$:
$$d\Omega=\frac{|d\bm{S}|}{r^2}$$
- If the centre is not at the centre of the sphere, or the surface is not spherical:
$$d\Omega=\frac{|d\bm{S}|}{r^2}\cos\theta=\frac{d\bm{S\cdot r}}{r^3}$$
- $\bm{r}$ points outwards from a closed surface, hence the surface normal points _inwards_
- The infinitesimal dipole moment of a current loop is $d\bm{m}=Id\bm{S}$
- Using the same formula as the [[#Dipoles|electrostatic potential of an electric dipole]]
$$\phi_m(r,\theta)=\frac{|d\bm{m}|\cos\theta}{4\pi r^2}$$
- By inspection and substituting the solid angle
- For a larger loop, simply add up all the $d\bm{m}$

- Hence, the magnetic scalar potential at some point is _proportional to the solid angle $\Omega$subtended by the loop when viewed from the observation point_
$$\phi_m=\frac{I\Omega}{4\pi}$$

### Ampere's Law
- Consider a current loop with current $I$
- Integration path: from one side to the loop, to infinity, circle back to the other side
- $\Omega$ along the path: $2\pi$, $0$, $-2\pi$
- The scalar potential along the path is _not single-valued_
- By considering the integral of $d\phi_m=d\bm{l}\cdot\nabla\phi_m$, one gets _Ampere's Law_:
$$\oint d\bm{l}\cdot\bm{B}=\mu_0I$$
- It can be expressed in terms of _current density_:
$$I=\int d\bm{S}\cdot\bm{J}$$
- Using Stokes' Theorem and the definition of magnetic field strength:
$$\nabla\wedge\bm{H}=\bm{J}$$

### Applying Ampere's Law
#### The infinite wire
- The magnetic field from an infinite wire with current $I$:
$$\bm{B}=\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r}\hat{\phi}$$
- By expressing the [[Vector calculus in 3-dimensions#Gradient in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates|gradient in cylindrical coordinates]], one can find the scalar potential:
$$\phi_m=-\frac{I\phi}{2\pi}$$
	- The field points _downhill_
	- The potential is _multi-valued_, and _potential difference cannot describe energy_

#### Two parallel infinite wires
- The _force per unit length_ between two infnite, parallel wires with separation $a$:
$$F=\frac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\pi a}$$
	- Attractive if the currents flow in the same direction

- The potential:
	- If the currents are in opposite directions, there is a _discontinuity_ along the line joining the wires
	- Same diection: discontinuity only occurs along a closed path enclosing a current

#### The solenoid
- A long solenoid with $n$ turns per unit length:
	- Consider a loop enclosing a section of the current, extending to infinity
	- Field outside the solenoid is zero
	$$B=\mu_0 nI$$

### The magnetic vector potential
- Define a magnetic vector potential $\bm{A}$:
$$\bm{B=\nabla\wedge A}$$
- Automatically fulfills Gauss' Law

- Scalar potentials are defined to within an arbitrary constant
- Vector potential determined to within a _gauge_ 

- Gauge: vector $\bm{K}$ which satisfies
$$\bm{K}=K_x(x)\bm{e}_x+K_y(y)\bm{e}_y+K_z(z)\bm{e}_z$$
- The divergence of $\bm{A+K}$ _is dependent on_ $\bm{K}$

- The definition of the vector potential _does not constrain the divergence_
- A typical gauge is:
$$\bm{\nabla\cdot A}=0$$

- From Ampere's Law, the Poisson's equation for the magnetic vector potential:
$$-\nabla^2\bm{A}=\mu_0\bm{J}$$
- By _comparing with the electrostatic_ case:
$$\bm{A}(\bm{r})=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int \frac{\bm{J}(\bm{r'})}{|\bm{r-r'}|}\,d^3\bm{r'}$$

- $\bm{A}$ analagous to $V$, $\rho$ analagous to $\bm{J}$

- Special relativity: the potential 4-vector $(V,\bm{A})$ and the density $(\rho,\bm{J})$
	- Static charge is the source of the electric field
	- Moving charge is the source of the magnetic field
	- When changing the observer, the fields also change

### Current resistivity and conductivity
- Consider a volume of material with surface area $S$, length $l$ and a potential difference of $V$
- The current follows Ohm's Law:
$$V=IR$$
- The current is proportional to $V$, $S$, and $1/l$
- $V=|\bm{E}|/l$, $J=I/S$
- From this, Ohm's Law can be _reformulated to include current_:
$$\bm{J}=\sigma\bm{E}$$
- $\sigma$ is the _conductivity_, equal to $1/\rho$, where $\rho$ is the _resistivity_

### Magnetostatic fields in homogeneous magnetic materials
- Magnetically polarisable materials change how magnetic field lines behave
- Types: _diamagnetic_, _paramagnetic_, _ferromagnetic_
- Properties stem from _magnetic dipole moments of atoms and molecules_
	- Dipole moments: orbital and intrinsic spin angular momenta of electrons

- Diamagnetic materials: _oppose applied external magnetic field_
- Paramagnetic materials: _permanent dipoles align with external magnetic field_
- Ferromagnetic materials: _effect of alignment is enhanced_

#### Volume magnetisation currents
- Magnetisation currents create small dipole moments
- Randomly aligned dipoles produce no net circulating current, and no net dipole moment
- Aligned dipoles produce net circulating current and dipole moment

- _Magnetisation_ $\bm{M}$: _magnetic_ dipole moment _per unit volume_
$$\bm{M}=\frac{d\bm{m}}{dV}$$
- Total dipole moment:
 $$\bm{m}_\text{tot}=\int d^3\bm{r}\,\bm{M}$$
	 - Random alignment leads to a vector sum of zero

- Consider four current loops with a common edge along one Cartesian axis
- One can then find the _magnetisation current density_ $\bm{J}_m$:
$$\bm{J}_m=\nabla\wedge\bm{M}$$
- Magnetisation current is _distinct from moving free charge_
- Analagous to [[#Homogeneous Dielectrics|electrostatic case]]
- Current can be said to be _fictitious_ as it only serves to model atomic dipole moments

- Uniform magnetisation leads to zero bound current as currents around loops sum to zero

#### Surface magnetisation currents
- For a uniform $\bm{M}$, some magnetisation currents must reside on the surface

- Consider a block with uniform magnetisation
- All currents cancel out inside
- On the surface, there is a charge density $\sigma$ flowing
- The current can be described by the _surface current density_ $\bm{K}_m$
$$I=\int \bm{K}_m\cdot d\bm{l}$$
- By considering one surface of the block, the surface current density is:
$$\bm{K}_m=\bm{M}\wedge\bm{\hat{n}}$$
#### Ampere's Law in magnetic materials
- Total current = flow of free charge + magnetisation current
- Magnetisation current _will also produce a force on some test current_
- Modify Ampere's Law accordingly:
$$\nabla\wedge\bm{B}=\mu_0[\bm{J}_\text{free}+\bm{J}_m]$$
- Define the _magnetic field strength_ $\bm{H}$:
$$\mu_0\bm{H}=\bm{B}-\mu_0\bm{M}$$
- Then, Ampere's Law becomes:
$$\nabla\wedge\bm{H}=\bm{J}_\text{free}$$
- Using Stokes' Theorem:
$$\oint \bm{H}\cdot d\bm{l}=I_\text{free}$$
- This form is independent of material properties

#### Magnetic permeability in materials
- To calculate forces, $\bm{B}$ is needed, and $\bm{M}$ is required for that
- For _most materials, in the small-field limit_, $\bm{M}$ is linearly proportional to $\bm{H}$:
$$\bm{M}=\chi_m\bm{H}$$
- $\chi_m$ is the _magnetic permeability_
- The magnetic field is then given by:
$$\bm{B}=\mu_0(1+\chi_m)\bm{H}\equiv\mu_0\mu\bm{H}$$
- $\mu$ is the _relative permeability_

- Non-magnetic materials: $\mu\approx 1$
- Unlike electric susceptibility, magnetic permeability can be _positive or negative_
- Magnetic materials:
	- Diamagnetics - $\chi_m<0$
	- Paramagnetics - $\chi_m>0$
	- Ferromagnetics - $\chi_m>>1$

- Ferromagnetic materials: $\bm{B}$ and $\bm{H}$ _become non-linear_
	- Ferromagnetics can display _hyteresis_
	- Materials can be _permanently magnetised_

- Like the case of dielectrics, susceptibility can be a _tensor_ for anisotropic materials
	- $\bm{B}$ does not need to be parallel to $\bm{H}$

### Inhomogeneous magnetic materials and boundary conditions
- Consider a flat boundary with a discontinuity in $\mu$, with _no free current_

- The perpendicular component of $\bm{B}$: use _Gauss' Law for the magnetic field_
$$\bm{B}_{1\perp}=\bm{B}_{2\perp}$$
- $\bm{H}_\perp$ will then be discontinuous

- The parallel component of $\bm{H}$: use _Ampere's Law_
$$\bm{H}_{1||}=\bm{H}_{2||}$$
- $\bm{B}_{||}$ will then be discontinuous

- The magnetisable sphere:
	- No free current --> consider the [[#The magnetic scalar potential|magnetic scalar potential]]
	- Similar solution to dielectric sphere:
	$$\bm{H}_\text{in}=\frac{3}{\mu+2}\bm{H}_0$$

- Uniformly magnetised cylinder: model for a bar magnet
	- Magnetisation currents flow around the surface, _similar to solenoid_
	- Small-field approximation for $\bm{M}$ _no longer applies
	- From the definition of $\bm{H}$, it _is opposite to $\bm{B}$ inside the magnet_
	- Field lines at cylindrical surface will curve due to edge effects

### Comparing behaviour of electric and magnetic fields
- Fundamental quantities in electrostatics and magnetostatics:
	- $\bm{E}$ gives force on a test charge
	- $\bm{B}$ gives force on a test current

- $\bm{H}=\bm{B}/(\mu_0\mu)$ and $\bm{D}=\epsilon\epsilon_0\bm{E}$ are _derived quantities_ for magnetic materials and dielectrics
	- Free charges are the source of $\bm{D}$
	- Free currents are the source of $\bm{H}$

- In terms of boundary conditions:
	- $\bm{B}$ and $\bm{D}$ are alike
	- $\bm{H}$ and $\bm{E}$ are alike
- Normal components of $\bm{B}$ and $\bm{D}$ are _continuous_, making them _conserved fluxes_

![[Boundary conditions.png|250px]]

### Electromagnets
- Consider a _coil of wire_ wrapped around a _toroidal core_ of magnetisable material
- Assume $N$ turns with current $I$ around a _continuous_ toroidal core
- Core: high permeability $\mu$

- Apply _Ampere's law_ around a closed loop, _inside the core_
- If cross-sectional width is _much smaller_ than radius $r$:
$$\bm{H}_\text{in}=\frac{NI}{2\pi r}\hat{\phi}$$
- The _magnetic field_ is:
$$\bm{B}_\text{in}=\frac{\mu_0\mu NI}{2\pi r}\hat{\phi}$$

- Consider a small _air gap_ of length $l$
- Magnetic field $\bm{B}$ is _continuous across the gap_
$$\bm{B}_\text{gap}=\bm{B}_\text{in}$$
- Applying Ampere's Law again:
$$(2\pi r-l)H_\text{gap}+lH_\text{in}=NI$$
- Across the gap, the field is:
$$\displaylines{H_\text{gap}=\frac{\mu NI}{2\pi r+(\mu-1)l} \\ B_\text{gap}\approx \frac{\mu_0NI}{l}}$$
- Approximation works _for high $\mu$_
- Since $\bm{B}$ is conserved across the loop, $H_\text{gap}>>H_\text{in}$

## Electromagnetic induction
- What happens when fields change with time
- _Not quasi-static changes_
- In electrostatics: static charge gives rise to electric fields
- In magnetostatics: moving charge gives rise to magnetic fields

### Faraday's Law
- Empirical findings: 
	- Changing magnetic flux gives an electromotive force (EMF)
	- EMF magnitude proportional to rate of flux change

- Faraday's Law:
$$\oint d\bm{l}\cdot\bm{E}(\bm{r})=-\frac{d}{dt}\int_S d\bm{S}\cdot \bm{B}(\bm{r})$$
- Left term: electromotive force
- Right term: rate of change of magnetic flux

- EMF: _line integral of $\bm{E}$ around closed loop_, not the same as potential difference
- Work done on a unit charge if it travels around the loop

- _Self-inductance_: a _change in current_ flowing in a coil induces an _emf across its own terminals_
	- Also occurs in lengths of wire

- Lenz's Law: induced EMF always promotes a current flow to produce a magnetic field _opposing the change in flux_

- The differential form of Faraday's Law:
$$\nabla\wedge\bm{E}=-\pd{\bm{B}}{t}$$
- When magnetic field is time-independent, the curl vanishes as in the electrostatic case

### EMF from the Lorentz Force
- An _alternative perspective_ on electromagnetic induction
- Consider the _"work done"_ on a moving charge in a _static magnetic field_
	- From the frame of the charge, it experiences an "electric field" $\bm{E}=\bm{v\wedge B}$

- Consider this applied to a loop moving through a constant magnetic field:
$$\mathcal{E}=\oint d\mathcal{E}=\oint (\bm{v}\wedge \bm{B})\cdot d\bm{l} $$
- By exchanging $\bm{v}$ and $\bm{B}$, and writing $\bm{v}\wedge d\bm{l}$ as $d\bm{S}/dt$:
$$\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d}{dt}\int_\text{loop}\bm{S}\cdot\bm{B}=-\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$

- Faraday's Law _DOES NOT CARE_ if the field is static and the circuit is changing, or vice versa

### Self-inductance
- The flux _linked back into_ a circuit as a consequence of the current in the same circuit
- Change in current --> change in $\bm{B}$ --> change in flux --> voltage
- Heavily dependent on geometry

- The _self-inductance_ is defined as:
$$L\equiv\frac{\Phi}{I}$$

- Example: a solenoid
	- The flux linked back to the _complete circuit includes all loops_
	- From this, the self-inductance _per unit length_ is:
$$\frac{L}{l}=\mu_0n^2S$$

- For most circuits, _flux within the wires_ is insignificant as _penetration depth_ is very low for higher frequencies

### Inductors and capacitors in circuits
- Consider an _open loop of wire_ with a small gap
	- Electric field is _zero inside the wire_, so it does not contribute to the line integral
$$V_\text{gap}=-\int_\text{gap} d\bm{l}\cdot\bm{E}=+\frac{d\Phi}{dt}=L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
- Consider a [[#Capacitance|capacitor]], the definition of capacitance gives:
$$I=C\frac{dV}{dt}$$
- Consider a circuit with capacitace, resistance and inductance, with no time-dependent $\bm{B}$:
$$V=\frac{q}{C}+IR+L\frac{dI}{dt}$$
- The power delivered by the battery is:
$$VI=\frac{q}{C}I+I^2R+LI\frac{dI}{dt}=I^2R+\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{q^2}{C}+\frac{1}{2}LI^2\right)$$
- Therefore, the _energies stored_ in capacitors and inductors are:
$$U_C=\frac{1}{2}CV^2\hspace{1cm}U_L=\frac{1}{2}LI^2$$
- In capacitors, energy is stored in the _electric field_
- In inductors, energy is stored in the _magnetic field
- Resistors only _dissipate_ energy

- Energy storing or dissipating components in physics can be _modelled as equivalent circuits_

### Mutual inductance
- Consider two coils next to each other
- Current $I_1$ in coil 1 produces a flux that links to loop 2, and vice versa
- The _mutual inductance_ $M_{21}$ is defined as:
$$M_{21}=\frac{\Phi_2}{I_1}$$

- Consider a system where $I_1$ is slowly turned on, _followed by_ $I_2$, the energy can be shown to equal:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}L_1I_1^2+\frac{1}{2}L_2I_2^2+M_{12}I_1I_2$$
- This must be _independent_ of which current is switched on first, hence:
$$M_{12}=M_{21}=M$$
- Sign convention of $M$: positive if the currents _produce fluxes in the sam0e direction_

- The mutual inductance can be _combined_ with self-inductance:
$$V_1=L_1I_1+MI_2 \hspace{1.25cm} V_2=L_2I_2+MI_1$$
- Consider two circuits with 2 separate inductors $L_1$ and $L_2$, and mutual inductance $M$:
	- By considering power, the energy is given by the same expression as above

- Rewrite the total energy by completing the square _with respect to_ $I_1$, since the total energy _cannot be negative_, it can be shown that:
$$L_1L_2\geq M^2$$
- We can define a _coupling coefficient_ $k$:
$$M=k\sqrt{L_1L_2}$$
	- $k=0$: No coupling
	- $k=1$: Perfect coupling

- Consider a _doubly wound_ solenoid (wound by 2 _separate_ wires with _different currents and loop density_)
	- For this system, $k=1$

### Transformers
- Consider two coils with number of turns $N_1$ and $N_2$ _coupled by a core of ferromagnetic material_
- Ideality:
	- All flux is _perfectly captured_ by both coils, $k=1$
	- Wires are prerfect conductors, core is linear, no hysteresis

- By considering total flux linkage of the two coils:
$$\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\frac{N_1}{N_2}$$
- Consider a circuit with 2 voltage sources $V_1$ and $V_2$, with currents $I_1$ and $I_2$, the relationship between impedances can be shown to be:
$$Z_1=\frac{j\omega L_1Z_2(N_1/N_2)^2}{j\omega L_1+Z_2(N_1/N_2)^2}\approx Z_2\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)^2$$

### Energy flow in circuits
- Consider a circuit with resistance $R$, inductance $L$, and capacitor $C$
- With current $I=I_0\cos(\omega t)$, the powers are:
$$P_R(t)=I_0^2R\cos^2\omega t \hspace{1cm} P_L(t)=-\frac{1}{2}I_0^2\omega L\sin2\omega t \hspace{1cm} P_C(t)=\frac{1}{2}I_0^2\frac{1}{\omega C}\sin2\omega t$$
- Energy _always flows into the resistor_ and is dissipated
- Energy is _exchanged between the inductor and capacitor_

- _Resonance_ condition: $P_L+P_C=0$ at all times
	- The same amount of energy is always exchanged between the inductor and capacitor
	- Overall, the only energy supplied is to _compensate for resistive losses_
	- This occurs at the _resonance frequency_ $\omega_0$:
$$\omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$

- $\omega>\omega_0$: $1/\omega C<\omega L$, circuit _looks more like an inductor_ as the capacitor does not store as much energy

- Many electrical systems can be modelled as an $LRC$ circuit


### Magnetic energy
- [[#Electrostatic energy]]: energy _stored in the field_ as _charges are assembled_
- Magnetostatic energy: energy _stored in the field_ as _current loops are assembled_

- By considering a _collection of current loops_, and using the expression for energy [[#Mutual inductance|above]]:
$$U=\sum_\text{loops} \frac{1}{2}\Phi_i I_i$$
- This _includes the energy stored in individual loops_, not just the energy needed to assemble them
	- $\Phi_i$ includes contributions from $M$ and $L$
	- Contributions from $L$: _self-energies_
	- Contributions from $M$: _interaction energies_
	- Energy needed to _assemble_ system: redefine $\Phi_i$ to not include own contribution

- To find a general expression, rewrite the magnetic flux as:
$$\Phi=\int d\bm{S\cdot B}=\oint d\bm{l\cdot A}$$
- Substituting this into the expression above, and using $Id\bm{l}=\bm{J}\,d^3\bm{r}$:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}\int\,d^3\bm{r}\,\bm{J\cdot A}$$

- For _magnetostatic_ problems:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}\int\,d^3\bm{r}\,\bm{A}\cdot(\nabla\wedge\bm{H})=\frac{1}{2}\left[\int d^3\bm{r}\,\bm{H}\cdot\bm{B}-\oint d\bm{S}\cdot(\bm{A\wedge\bm{H}})\right]$$
- Similar to electrostatic energy, by taking the integration surface at infinity:
$$U=\frac{1}{2}\int d^3\bm{r}\,\bm{H}(\bm{r})\cdot B(\bm{r})$$
- The integrand is the _magnetic field energy density_
- This should be compared to the expression for electric field energy density

## Maxwell's equations
- With the Maxwell's equations we have now, _conservation of charge is only satisfied in the steady state_
	- Substitute $\nabla\wedge\bm{H}=\bm{J}$ into the continuity equation

- Maxwell proposed adding a _displacement current_ to Ampere's Law:
$$\nabla\wedge H=\bm{J}+\pd{\bm{D}}{t}$$
- By substituting this into the continuity equation, it can be seen that it is satisfied

- Here, one gets Maxwell's equations _in their full glory_
$$\displaylines{\nabla\cdot\bm{D}=\rho \\ \nabla\wedge E=-\pd{\bm{B}}{t} \\ \nabla\cdot\bm{B}=0 \\ \nabla\wedge H=\bm{J}+\pd{\bm{D}}{t}}$$

## Electromagnetic waves

### In free space
- In free space, Maxwell's equations are:
$$\displaylines{\nabla\cdot\bm{E}=0 \\ \nabla\wedge E=-\mu_0\pd{\bm{H}}{t} \\ \nabla\cdot\bm{H}=0 \\ \nabla\wedge H=\epsilon_0\pd{\bm{E}}{t}}$$

- By _taking the curl of the curl of $\bm{E}$_, and using the conditions of free space:
$$\nabla^2\bm{E}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\pd{^2\bm{E}}{t^2}$$
- By using a similar argument:
$$\nabla^2\bm{H}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\pd{^2\bm{H}}{t^2}$$
- In Cartesian coordinates, the Laplacian of the field is:
$$\nabla^2\bm{E}=(\nabla^2 E_x ,\nabla^2 E_y,\nabla^2E_z)$$
- From this, we see that _the fields satisfy the [[Waves#The wave equation|wave equation]]_
- The speed of the wave is:
$$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}}=299,792,458 \text{ m s}^{-1}$$
- The speed is _the same for all observers_, leading to Einstein's [[Relativity|special theory of relativity]]

### Plane wave in isotropic medium along the z-direction
- Let the plane wave be propagating along $z$:
$$\pd{\psi(\bm{r},t)}{x}=\pd{\psi(\bm{r},t)}{y}=0$$
- _By considering the curls_, one can see that _longitudinal components are static_
- Hence, EM waves are _transverse waves_

- The _polarisation_ of the wave is defined by the electric field
- The components of $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{H}$ are _linked by Maxwell's equations_

- $x-$polarisation: $E_z$ and $H_y$ propagate _in-phase_ along the $z-$direction at $c$
$$\pd{H_y}{z}=-\epsilon_0\pd{E_x}{t}\hspace{1cm} \pd{E_x}{z}=-\mu_0\pd{H_y}{t}$$

- $y-$polarisation: $E_y$ and $H_x$ propagate _in-phase_ along the $z-$direction at $c$
$$\pd{H_x}{z}=\\\epsilon_0\pd{E_y}{t}\hspace{1cm} \pd{E_y}{z}=\mu_0\pd{H_z}{t}$$

- For linear, isotropic, homogeneous, non-conducting media:
$$v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon\epsilon_0\mu\mu_0}}=\frac{c}{n}$$
- $n$ is the _refractive index_:
$$c=\sqrt{\epsilon\mu}$$
- For non-magnetic materials:
$$c\approx\sqrt{\epsilon}$$

- The _form of a travelling wave_ ($x$-polarised), generated by a _sinusoidally oscillating_ current:
$$E_x=\Re\{E_0\exp[i(kz-\omega t)]\}$$
- The dispersion relation is:
$$\frac{\omega}{k}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}}=c=f\lambda$$
- Applying this to the relation between components:
$$\frac{E_x}{H_y}=\frac{k}{\epsilon_0\omega}=\frac{1}{\epsilon_0c}=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}}$$
- This shows that _the fields are locked in phase_
- The magnitudes are related by:
$$Z_0\equiv\sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}}=377\,\Omega$$
	- The _impedance of free space_
	- Does not dissipate power, waves _only transmit power_

>[!quote]
>"'Impedance of free space' is my least favourite term in physics, because it's not impeding anything!"
>-Dr. Oleg Brandt, 2022

- In a linear, isotropic, homogeneous, non-conducting medium, the impedance is:
$$Z=\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\epsilon}}Z_0$$

- The relationship between the _magnitudes of the $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{B}$ fields_:
$$E_x=cB_y$$
- When the wave is travelling in _negative $z$ direction, or $y$-polarised_, quantities such as impedance _become negative_ but with the same magnitude

- $\bm{E}$, $\bm{H}$, and the propagation direction _always form a right-handed coordinate system_

### General plane waves
- The phase of the field components is, in general (for position vector $\bm{x}$):
$$\bm{k\cdot x}-\omega t$$
- The fields themselves:
$$\displaylines{\bm{E}=\bm{E}_0\exp[i(\bm{k\cdot x}-\omega t)] \\ \bm{H}=\bm{H}_0\exp[i(\bm{k\cdot x}-\omega t)]}$$
- It can be shown that:
$$\displaylines{\nabla\cdot\bm{E}=i\bm{k\cdot E} \\ \nabla\wedge\bm{E}=i\bm{k\wedge E}}$$
- The Maxwell's equations become:
$$\displaylines{\bm{k\cdot E}_0=0 \\ \bm{k\cdot H}_0=0 \\ \bm{k\wedge E}_0=\omega\mu_0\bm{H}_0 \\ \bm{k}\wedge\bm{H}_0=-\omega\epsilon_0\bm{E}_0}$$
- First pair: _The fields are always transverse to the propagation direction_
- Second pair: $\bm{E}_0$, $\bm{H}_0$, and $\bm{k}$ _form a right-handed system_

- By combining the second pair of equations, one finds $\omega^2/k^2=c^2$, as expected
- From the second-last equation:
$$\bm{H}_0=\frac{1}{c\mu_0}\bm{\hat{k}}\wedge\bm{E}_0=\frac{1}{Z_0}\bm{\hat{k}}\wedge\bm{E}_0$$

- _Any field_ can be written as a _linear combination of plane waves_:
$$\bm{E}(\bm{x},t)=\iiiint d^3\bm{k}\,d\omega\,\bm{A}_s(\bm{k},\omega)\, \exp[i(\bm{k\cdot x-\omega t})]$$
- $\bm{A}_s$ is known as the _spectral function_
- The spectral function is the 3-dimensional [[Fourier series and transforms|Fourier transform]] of the field

### Energy flow in electromagnetic waves
- Work done on a charge is calculated by the [[Electromagnetism#The Lorentz Force and the Biot-Savart Law|Lorentz force]]
- As force from the $\bm{B}$ field $\perp \bm{v}$, the _magnetic force does no work_

- For a _continuous charge distribution_, the _rate_ at which the electric field does work is:
$$\int d^3\bm{r}\,\rho\,\bm{E}\cdot\bm{v}=\int\,d^3\bm{r}\,\bm{E}\cdot\bm{J}$$
- Hence, the _work done on charges per unit volume, per unit time_ is $\bm{E}\cdot\bm{J}$

- By _considering the volume integral of_ $\nabla\cdot(\bm{E\cdot H})$, and _Maxwell's equations_:
$$-\oint d\bm{S}\cdot(\bm{E\wedge H})=\int_V\,d^3\bm{r}\left(\pd{}{t}\left[\frac{\mu_0}{2}\bm{H\cdot H}\right]+\pd{}{t}\left[\frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\bm{E\cdot E}\right]+\bm{E\cdot J}\right)$$
- The right hand side is _the rate at which energy is flowing into the volume_

- The integrand on the left hand side is the _Poynting vector_:
$$\bm{N}=\bm{E\wedge H}$$
- The magnitude of $\bm{N}$ represents _power flow per unit area_
- Direction of $\bm{N}$ is _direction of energy flow_

### Pressure and momentum for plane waves
- Using [[Relativity|Einstein's energy-momentum relation]], and the fact that _photons are massless_:
$$E=|\bm{p}|c$$
- The _energy per unit volume_ $U$ is related to _radiation momentum density_ $\bm{g}$ by:
$$U=|\bm{g}|c$$
- By considering _radiation incident normally on a surface_, one gets:
$$\bm{g}=\frac{\bm{N}}{c^2}$$
- By considering the _rate of change of momentum_, one gets the _radiation pressure_:
$$\bm{R}=\frac{\bm{N}}{c}$$
- If the light is _reflected_, the _pressure doubles_

### Complex power in electrical components and waves
#### Electrical components
- Consider some electrical component with voltage and current:
$$\displaylines{V=V_0\cos(\omega t-\phi) \\ I=I_0\cos\omega t}$$
- By expanding the cosines, the _time-averaged power_, or _real power_ becomes:
$$P_r=\frac{1}{2}V_0I_0\cos\phi$$
	- Measures average rate of power dissipation
- There is also an extra term which oscillates as $\sin2\omega t$ and averages to 0, with _peak value_:
$$P_i=\frac{1}{2}V_0I_0\sin\phi$$
	- Measures maximum rate at which power sloshes into and out of the component
	- Also called the _reactive power_

- By replacing the cosines with _complex exponentials_, the _complex power_ is:
$$P=\frac{1}{2}IV^*$$
- $P_r$ and $P_i$ are the _real and imaginary parts_ respectively

- _Power flow_ can be represented by a vector in the complex plane
- When two components are connected, the complex power flow is _the combined sum in the complex plane_ for the two components, _regardless of how they are connected_

#### Waves
- The Poynting vector gives _instantaneous power flow per unit area_ at a given point
- If $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{H}$ are _complex_, the _time-averaged power_ is:
$$P_r=\frac{1}{2}\Re\left[\bm{E}(\bm{r})\wedge\bm{H}(\bm{r})\right]$$
- The _maximum rate at which energy sloshes_ backwards and forwards is:
$$P_i=\frac{1}{2}\Im\left[\bm{E}(\bm{r})\wedge\bm{H}^*(\bm{r})\right]$$
- For _plane waves_, since the fields are in phase, _power is always real_

### Reflection and transmission at interfaces
- Consider a plane wave with wavevector $\bm{k}$, incident on a _plane dielectric boundary_
- Refractive indices in _incident and transmitted regions_ are $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively
- A _transmitted_ wave, $\bm{k}_t$ and _reflected_ wave $\bm{k}_r$ are produced
- The wavevectors and frequencies _should not be assumed to be identical_ at this point
- The angles $\theta$ are _between plane normal and the wavevectors_

- By using the [[#Inhomogeneous dielectrics and boundary conditions|boundary conditions]] of the electric field, which _must be true for all $x$ and $t$_:
$$\displaylines{\omega_i=\omega_r=\omega_t \\ k_i\sin\theta_i=k_r\sin\theta_r=k_t\sin\theta_t}$$
	- The waves must be _phase-matched_

- The magnitude of the wavevector _depends on the refractive index_ of the two media
- From this, the _law of reflection_, as well as _Snell's Law_ are derived:
$$\displaylines{\theta_i=\theta_r \\ \frac{\sin\theta_t}{\sin\theta_i}=\frac{n_2}{n_1}}$$
### Fresnel's relations
- There are separate relations depending on if the wave is _polarised parallel or normal to the plane of incidence_
- The _reflection and transmission coefficients_ can be derived from _using boundary conditions for the $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{H}$ fields_:
$$\displaylines{r_{||}=\frac{\tan(\theta_i-\theta_t)} {\tan(\theta_i+\theta_t)} \hspace{1.5cm} t_{||}=\frac{2\cos\theta_i}{(n_2/n_1)\cos\theta_i+\cos\theta_t} \\ r_\perp=-\frac{\sin(\theta_i-\theta_t)}{\sin(\theta_i+\theta_t)} \hspace{1.5cm} t_\perp=\frac{2\cos\theta_i}{\cos\theta_i+(n_2/n_1)\cos\theta_t}}$$


- Reflection coefficients _can take negative values_
- The _power reflection and transmission_ coefficients are _proportional_ to the amplitude coefficients _squared_ 
	- Need to scale by refractive index due to difference in wave velocity

- There is also an angle at which $r_{//}=0$, called the _Brewster's angle_ $\theta_B$:
$$\tan\theta_B=\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
	- In other words, $\theta_i+\theta_t=\pi/2$

- If $n_1>n_2$, there is a _critical angle_ $\theta_c$ such that when $\theta_i>\theta_c$ _all incident power is reflected_
$$\sin\theta_c=\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
- Occurs regardless of polarisation
- This is _total internal reflection_
- At this angle, $\theta_t=\pi/2$
- There is an _evanescent wave_ in the transmission medium, so _no power is transmitted_

### Waves in plasmas
- Plasmas: _conduction currents are present_, density of atoms is _low_
	- Electrons move coherently, power is _undamped_
- Approximation: the _ions are stationary_ as they are much bigger than electrons
- Approximation: $|\bm{v}|<<c$, _only force from the electric field is significant_

- Suppose a free electron is illuminated by a plane EM wave
- Substituting $\bm{E}$ from the wave into the _equation of motion_, one gets:
$$\bm{r}=\frac{e}{m_e\omega^2}\bm{E}_0\exp[i(kz-\omega t)]$$
- Amplitude _proportional to_ $1/m$ and $1/\omega^2$

- The oscillation gives rise to a _dipole moment_, causing a _polarisation_:
$$\bm{P}=N\bm{p}=-\frac{Ne^2}{m_e\omega^2}\bm{E}$$
- Hence, the _relative permittivity in plasma_ can be written as:
$$\epsilon=1-\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}$$
- The _plasma frequency_ $\omega_p$ is:
$$\omega_p=\frac{Ne^2}{\epsilon_0m_e}$$

#### Below plasma frequency
- Below $\omega_p$, _refractive index is imaginary_
- A non-propagating, _evanescent wave_ will occur in the transmitted medium:
$$\bm{E}=\bm{E}_0\exp\left[-k_0z\left|1-\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\right|^{1/2}\right]\exp(-i\omega t)$$
- Since the refractive index is imaginary, $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{H}$ are _$\pi/2$ out of phase_
- The _time-averaged Poynting vector_ is zero
- There is no net transfer of energy, only "sloshing" of energy
	- Stored in the motion of electrons

#### Above plasma frequency
- The wave is _dispersive_
- The [[Waves#Group velocity|dispersion relation]] is:
$$\omega=\frac{ck}{\sqrt{1-\omega_p^2/\omega^2}}$$
- Phase velocity _can be larger than $c$_
- Group velocity _approaches $c$_ as $\omega$ goes to infinity
- $v_\phi v_g=c^2$

### Waves in conducting media
- Conductors: density of electrons and nuclei is _high_, _scattering is significant_
	- Power is dissipated
- Relevant relations:
$$\displaylines{\bm{D}=\epsilon\epsilon_0\bm{E} \\ \bm{B}=\mu\mu_0\bm{H} \\ \bm{J}=\sigma\bm{E} \\ \nabla\wedge\bm{H}=\sigma\bm{E}+\epsilon\epsilon_0\pd{\bm{E}}{t}}$$
- For solutions:
$$\bm{E}=\bm{E}_0\exp(-i\omega t) \hspace{1.5cm}\bm{H}=\bm{H}_0\exp(i\omega t)$$
- From the equations above, there is an _effective dielectric constant_ $\epsilon'$:
$$\nabla\wedge\bm{H}=-i\omega\epsilon'\epsilon_0\bm{E}\equiv-i\omega\left(1+\frac{i\sigma}{\omega\epsilon_0}\right)\bm{E}$$
- For metals, _the imaginary part dominates_ for typical optical frequencies
- Both the effective dielectric constant _and the refractive index_ are complex:
$$n=\sqrt{\epsilon'\mu}\approx\sqrt{\frac{i\sigma\mu}{\omega\epsilon_0}}=\pm\frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{\frac{\sigma\mu}{\omega\epsilon_0}}$$
- By substiuting a [[#General plane waves|plane wave]] solution, and defining the _skin depth_ $\delta$:
$$\displaylines{\delta\equiv\sqrt{\frac{2}{\sigma\omega\mu_0\mu}} \\ \bm{E}=\bm{E}_0\exp\left[-\frac{z}{\delta}\right]\exp\left[i\left(\frac{z}{\delta}-\omega t\right)\right]}$$
- The amplitude of the travelling wave _decays_ with penetration depth $\delta$
- The depth is typically very small

- Using the relations between $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{H}$ again, one can see that they are $\pi/4$ _out of phase_
	- $H_y$ is _behind_ $E_x$
- The Poynting vector can be _instantaneously_ positive _or negative_
- On _average_, energy travels forwards as it is dissipated

#### Skin effect of wires
- Consider a wire carrying a current $I$ oscillating at frequency $\omega$
- As power flows _along_ the wire, the _Poynting vector_ also has a large _component_ along it
- For a metal with finite conductivity, the _electric field is also along the wire_
- From also calculating $\bm{H}$, there is also a _component of the Poynting vector pointing towards the surface_

- For a wire where radius $>>\delta$, _more current flows on the outside_
	- Decays with depth $\delta$ as current goes into the wire
- As frequency increases, the current is _more confined_ and resistance _increases_

## Guided waves
- Due to the skin effect, wires _become lossy at high frequencies_
- If the dimension of the object $d$ is _comparable to or larger than_ $\lambda$, voltage and current _cannot be assumed to be constant_ along the wire
	- $\lambda>>d$: classical circuits
	- $\lambda\approx d$: transmission lines
	- $\lambda<<d$: waveguides

### Transmission lines
#### Parallel wires
- Two parallel wires along the $z-$direction
- The two currents travel in _opposite directions_, with the same magnitude $I(z)$
- There is a voltage $V(z)$ between the wires
- $V$ and $I$ are _functions of both time and position_

- The system has some inductance $L$ and capacitance $C$ _per unit length_
- By considering _infinitesimal changes_ in both $V$ and $I$ across $dz$:
$$\displaylines{\pd{V}{z}=-L\pd{I}{t} \\ \pd{I}{z}=-C\pd{V}{t}}$$
- Differentiating again, one gets the _wave equations_, with phase velocity:
$$v^2=\frac{1}{LC}$$
- Look for solutions of the form:
$$\displaylines{V=V_0\exp[i(kz-\omega t)] \\ I=I_0\exp[i(kz-\omega t)]}$$
- The _characteristic impedance_ of the transmission line is:
$$Z\equiv\frac{V}{I}=\frac{\omega L}{k}=\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}$$

- $V$ and $I$ are _locked in phase_
- Characteristic impedance if either $V$ or $I$ travel in the opposite drection is $-Z$

- Wires and transmission lines should be thought of as _transmitting electromagnetic energy_ instead of just conducting current

- Consider a _semi-infinite transmission line_, with a voltage generator at one end
- The transmission line can be _swapped for a resistor with resistance $Z$_

- Consider two parallel wires with radius $a$, distance $2D$ apart, where $2D>>a$
- The $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{H}$ fields are _transverse and orthogonal_
- The Poynting vector $\bm{N}$ points in the _same direction as the wire_ (symmetry)
- From previous calculations, the capacitance and inductance _per unit length_ are:
$$C=\frac{\pi\epsilon_0}{\ln(2D/a)} \hspace{1.5cm} L=\frac{\mu_0}{\pi}\ln(2D/a)$$
- The wave _propagates with the speed of light_
- If the wires are embedded _in a dielectric_ with refractive index $n$:
	- Impedance decreases by factor of $n$
	- _Wavelength decreases_ by a factor of $n$

- If the wires are _incompletely embedded_ in the dielectric, the wave _is not transverse_

#### Coaxial cylinders
- Consider coaxial cylinders with a medium of permittivity $\epsilon$ in between
- Inner and outer radii of the dielectric are $a$ and $b$

- The _electric field is radial_, _magnetic field is azimuthal_
- Poynting vector is _along the cylinders_, and the wave is _transverse_
- The capacitance and inductance per unit length are:
$$C=\frac{2\pi\epsilon\epsilon_0}{\ln(b/a)} \hspace{1.5cm} L=\frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\ln(b/a)$$
- The phase velocity is simply $c/n$

- If it is only partially filled with dielectric, the wave cannot be transverse

#### Strip transmission line
- Consider two flat strips of metal 'sandwiching' a substrate of thickness $d$
- One acts as a _ground plane_, the other is a _conducting strip with length $a$_

- Typically, $d<<a$ and _edge effects can be ignored_
- The capacitance and inductance are:
$$C=\frac{\epsilon\epsilon_0a}{d} \hspace{1.5cm} L=\frac{\mu_0d}{a}$$
- Again, the phase velocity is $c/n$

- Approximation that the wave is transverse _only holds for low frequencies_

#### Power flow in transmission lines
- The energy stored in a transmission line from $z=a$ to $z=b$ is:
$$U=\int_a^b\,dz\left(\frac{1}{2}LI^2+\frac{1}{2}CV^2\right)$$
- This is energy stored _in the fields_, with inductance and capacitance _distributed across the system_

- The rate of change of stored energy can be found to be:
$$\frac{dU}{dt}=[IV]_b-[IV]_a$$

- Considering a _load $R$ at the other end_ of a transmission line from a voltage source
- The source _carries energy away from the source towards the load_

- If $R=Z$, _all power is absorbed_ as $dU/dt=0$, and all power is absorbed
- If $R\neq Z$, _some power must be reflected_ as $dU/dt\neq0$

#### Reflection on transmission lines
- Let there be a terminal load with impedance $Z_t$, from its definition:
$$\frac{V_t}{I_t}=Z_t$$
- The forward and backwards travelling waves are:
$$\displaylines{V_i=V_1\exp[-i(kz-\omega t)]\hspace{1.5cm}I_i=I_1\exp[-i(kz-\omega t)] \\ V_r=V_2\exp[-i(-kz-\omega t)]\hspace{1.5cm}I_r=I_2\exp[-i(-kz-\omega t)]}$$
- Considering _boundary conditions_:
$$V_t=V_i+V_r \hspace{1.5cm} I_t=I_i+I_r$$
- Letting the $z=0$ at the load:
$$r\equiv\frac{V_2}{V_1}=\frac{Z_t-Z}{Z_t+Z} \hspace{1.5cm} t\equiv\frac{V_t}{V_1}=1+r=\frac{2Z_t}{Z_t+Z}$$


#### Input impedances on transmission lines
- Consider the length of the line to be $a$
- Assume the _input impedance_ to be $Z$, matched with the transmission line
- The input and reflected voltages and currents are:
$$\displaylines{V_i=V_1\exp[-i(kz-\omega t)] \hspace{1.5cm} I_i\equiv V_i/Z \\ V_r=rV_1\exp[-i(-kz-\omega t)] \hspace{1.5cm} I_r\equiv -V_r/Z}$$
- The impedance $Z_\text{in}$ is defined as:
$$Z_\text{in}=\frac{V_i+V_r}{I_i+I_r}\Bigg|_{z=-a}=\frac{e^{ika}+re^{-ika}}{e^{ika}-re^{-ika}}Z$$
- From the definition of $r$, one can show that:
$$\frac{Z_\text{in}}{Z}=\frac{Z_t\cos ka+iZ\sin ka}{Z\cos ka+iZ_t\sin ka}$$
- Hence, the _measured impedance_ depends on $a$ and $Z$

- For a _short-circuited_ line, where $Z_t\to0$, $Z_\text{in}/Z=i\tan ka$
	- Imaginary impedance means the load _cannot absorb power_
	- For $0<ka<\pi/2$, the impedance is _inductive_
	- For $\pi/2<ka<\pi$, the impedance is _capacitive_

- For an _open-circuited_ line, where $Z_t\to\infty$, $Z_\text{in}/Z=-i\cot ka$
	- Similar situation as above

- For a _quarter-wavelength line_, $ka=\pi/2$, and $Z_\text{in}=Z^2/Z_t$
	- Used to match impadances

### Waveguides
- More discussion: [[Waves#Guided waves]]

- Transmission lines support _transverse_ EM waves at high frequencies
- At very high frequencies, the _skin effect_ causes significant losses
- _Waveguides_ are often hollow tubes or _optical fibres_
	- Transmission lines are waveguides, but $V$ and $I$ still have some physical meaning
	- For waveguides, $\bm{E}$ and $\bm{H}$ need to be considered

- Consider 2 plane, $y-$polarised waves with wavevectors at angles $\pm\theta$ to the $z-$axis
$$\bm{k}_1=k(\bm{\hat{x}}\sin\theta+\bm{\hat{z}}\cos\theta) \hspace{1.5cm} \bm{k}_2=k(-\bm{\hat{x}}\sin\theta+\bm{\hat{z}}\cos\theta)$$
- It can easily be proven that the combination of the waves is:
$$E_y=2iE_0\exp[i(kz\cos\theta-\omega t)]\sin(kx\sin\theta)$$
- There are _planes of constant $x$_ where the _electric field vanishes_
- The wave _propagates in the $z-$direction while being standing in the $x-$direction_

- The _phase velocity_ is given by:
$$v_\phi=\frac{\omega}{k_\text{eff}}\equiv\frac{\omega}{k\cos\theta}$$
- Phase velocity can be _higher than $c$_
- Group velocity _must be lower than $c$_

- As there are planes where $E_y=0$, they can be _replaced with conductors_
- Hence, a waveguide can be _modelled as two parallel conducting plates_
- Placing one plate at $x=0$ and the other at $x=a$, the constraint on $k$ is:
$$k\sin\theta=\frac{m\pi}{a}$$
- Hence:
$$k_\text{eff}^2=k^2-\frac{m^2\pi^2}{a^2}$$

- It can be shown that _there is no $\bm{H}$ component perpendicular to the plates_
- There can be a component _parallel to the plates_ which goes to zero due to the skin effect

- The electric field has _modes_ with increasing number of nodes at values of $x$
- The modes are formed when _the spacing of the plates is larger than free-space $\lambda$_
- There is a _critical wavelength_, which wavelengths in the waveguide must be _under_
$$\lambda_c=2a$$
#### Rectangular waveguides
- As the field is $y-$polarised, the guide can be _completely closed_ by placing plates in _planes of constant $y$_ so there is no parallel field
- Since $H_y=0$, let any 2 plates be placed at $y=0$ and $y=b$
- As the waveguide is closed, there can be _no voltage difference_ between plates

- Notation for waveguides: $\text{TE}_{mn}$ has mode $m$ in the $x-$direction and $n$ in the $y-$direction
- _Electric field is always transverse_, while the $\bm{H}$ field has _both $x$ and $z$ components
	- $\bm{H}$ field _circulates_, giving rise to _currents in the plates_

#### The general rectangular case
- $\bm{E}$ can vary with _both $x$ and $y$
- The general solution for the $\text{TE}_{mn}$ is:
$$\displaylines{E_x=A_0k_y\cos(k_xx)\sin(k_yy)\cos(k_zz-\omega t) \\ E_y=-A_0k_x\sin(k_xx)\cos(k_yy)\cos(k_zz-\omega t) \\ E_z=0 \\ \bm{k}=\left(\frac{m\pi}{a},\frac{n\pi}{b},k_g\right)}$$
- The _waveguide equation_ is:
$$k_g^2=\frac{\omega^2}{c^2}-\frac{m^2\pi^2}{a^2}-\frac{n^2\pi^2}{b^2}\equiv k_0^2-k_c^2$$
- For propagating waves, $k_g$ _must be positive_, there is a _critical frequency_ that the wave must be above to propagate
- Below the _cutoff_, the wave will be _evanescent_
