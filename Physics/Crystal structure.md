# Mathematical description of lattices
## Lattice vectors
- Ideal crystal: infinite repitition of groups of atoms
- Basis/motif: repeated group of atoms
- Lattice vectors: If the lattice looks the same from 2 points $\bm{r}$ and $\bm{r'}$ , they satisfy:
$$\bm{r'-r}=u_1\bm{a_1}+u_2\bm{a_2}+u_3\bm{a_3}$$
	- where $\bm{a_1,a_2,a_3}$ are lattice vectors and $u_1,u_2,u_3$ are arbitrary integers
	- $\bm{r}$ and $\bm{r'}$: lattice points

## Lattice types ($\text{\textcolor{red}{Update when you get to group theory}}$)
- Primitive lattice: any 2 points from which the lattice looks the same always satisfies the above
	- Defines primitive translation vectors $\bm{a_i}$, where the smallest repeating unit has volume $\bm{a_1\cdot a_2\times a_3}$
	- Crystal axes can be (not always) defined by $\bm{a_1,a_2.a_3}$
- Primitive cell: parallelepipied defined by $\bm{a_i}$
	- All lattices (including non-primitive) are made of primitive cells
	- Other method of forming a primitive cell: Wigner-Seitz cell
- Forming a structure: adding a basis/motif to each lattice point
	- Each point in the basis canbe labelled as $\bm{r_j}=x_j\bm{a_1}+y_j\bm{a_2}+z_j\bm{a_3}$
	- Origin where $0<x_j,y_j,z_j<1$: associated lattice point
- Permitted rotational symmetries in a lattice: 1-,2-,3-,4-,6-fold
- Two-dimensional lattices: 5 Bravais lattice types

- Three-dimensional lattices: 14 Bravais lattice types
