# Main characteristics

## Heat
- The earth has _internal heat_

- The Earth can _lose heat_, with the current rate at $4\times 10^{13}\text{ W}$, or $80\text{ mW m}^{-2}$
- _Sources_ of heat:
	- _Release_ of _gravitational energy_
	- _Tidal dissipation_ of _kinetic energy_
	- _Radioactive decay_

- Earth's _temperature field_ is dependent on 
	- _Initial_ temperature distribution
	- Distribution (spatial and temporal) of _heat sources_
	- The _mechanism_ of _internal heat transfer_

- Heat flux is _low_ in _old continental sheilds or oceanic sea floor_ $(\approx 40\text{ mW m}^{-2})$
- Heat flux is _high_ in _tectonically active continental regions_, and _near ocean ridges_ $(\approx 100\text{ mW m}^{-2})$

- The primary means of _heat transfer_ is _convection_

## Gravitational field
- Gravitational field on the surface: $\approx 9.827\text{ ms}^{-2}$
	- Corresponds to _homogeneous sphere_ of mass $5.98\times 10^{24} \text{ kg}$ and radius $6.371\times 10^{5}\text{ m}$
- Gravity _fluctuates_ throughout the _surface_ of Earth, due to _asymmetry_ in mass distribution within the _crust and mantle_

- The _reference spheroid/ellipsoid_ is an _equipotential surface_ that coincides with _mean sea-level_ on an _imaginary rotating Earth_ with the _same mass and size_ as the _real_ Earth but with _uniform mass distribution_

- The _geoid_ is the _equipotential surface_ that coincides with the _mean sea level_ on the real Earth
	- Deviates from reference ellipsoid by up to $\pm 100\text{ m}$
