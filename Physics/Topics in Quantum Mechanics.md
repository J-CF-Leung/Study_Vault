## The Variational Principle
>[!info] The Variational Principle
Let there be an arbitrary Hamiltonian $\Ham$, with ground state energy $E_0$. For _any_ wave function $\wv$:
$$\braket{\Psi|\Ham|\Psi}\geq E_0$$

- Proof: expand $\ket{\Psi}$ in terms of the energy eigenkets
- Equality only holds if $\wv$ is _exactly the ground state eigenket_

- The 'trial' wave function must be a _physically motivated guess_
- The guess should _satisfy boundary conitions_
