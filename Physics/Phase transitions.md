## Landau theory
- Expanding the free energy density near critical point with a generalised parameter $\phi$
$$f(\phi,T)=f_0(T)+\alpha(T)\phi^2+\beta(T)\phi^4+\gamma(T)|\nabla\phi|^2$$
- Odd-order terms: absent due to symmetry
- Gradient term:
	- $f$ cannot be determined by $\nabla \phi$ by isotropy
