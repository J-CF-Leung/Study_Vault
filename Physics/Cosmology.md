>[!INFO] The Cosmological Principle
Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers
- Homogeneity: The Universe looks the same at every point
- Isotropy: The Universe looks the same in all directions

## Particles and radiation
### Particles
- Baryons (particles formed from 3 quarks): make up ordinary matter along with electrons, typically non-relativistic
- Photons
- Neutrinos: effectively massless, moving relativistically 
- Dark matter: WIMPs?
### Electromagnetic radiation
- Energy density due to blackbody radiation:
$$\epsilon(f)\,df = \frac{8\pi h}{c^3}\frac{f^3\,df}{\exp(hf/k_BT)-1}$$
	- Peak: $\approx 2.8k_BT$
	- Mean: $\approx 3k_BT$
	- Total energy density: $(\pi^2k_B^4/15\hbar^3c^3)T^4$
- Sources of visible light from smallest to largest:
	- Stars
	- Galaxies (Milky Way has a radius of 12.5 kpc)
	- Local group (Typical volume of several Mpc$^3$)
	- Galaxy clusters, superclusters with foam-like structure, and voids
	- At hundreds of Mpc away, the universe starts to appear smooth
- Microwaves: the CMB, with blackbody temperature of $\approx 3K$
- Infrared: young galaxies, far-away galaxies with red-shifted emitted radiation
	- Scattered less strongly by dust compared to visible light
- X-rays: Hot intergalactic gases ($\approx 10^6 K$, remnants from galaxy formation)
- Radio waves: Spin-flip of electrons in hydrogen atoms gives rise to 21cm emission line


## Expansion of the universe
- The universe is expanding
- Hubble's Law:
$$\bm{v}=H_0\bm{r}$$
	- $\bm{v}=$ velocity of recession
	- $\bm{r}=$ displacement from observer
	- Same no matter where the observer is

- Proof of receding objects: red shift $z$
$$z=\frac{\lambda_{obs}-\lambda_{em}}{\lambda_{em}}$$
	- Close objects, non-relativistic: $z=v/c$
	- Close objects (ignoring propagation time), relativistic: $1+z=\sqrt{(1+v/c)/(1-v/c)}$
