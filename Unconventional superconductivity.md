- _Conventional_ superconductivity: 
	- Electron-phonon coupling leadsto a _retarded attractive potential_
		- Given by Eliashberg theory
	- The _pairs_ form a _gapped, macroscopic coherent state_
	- Described by some _order parameter_ $\sqrt{ n }\exp(i\theta)$
	- $s-$wave superconductivity: singlets,opposite momenta
	- "Magnetism destroys superconductivity"

# Iron based superconductors (Coldea)
- Example: $\ce{ FeSe }$
- Phase diagram:
	- Electronic nematic phase: breaking isotropy
	- Spin density waves

- Superconductivity _boosted_ by electron doping

- Heavy fermion material
- Multi-band ($d$ bands) superconductor
	- Fermi surfaces mapped out by ARPES
	- _Orbital-dependent mass renormalisation_
	- Electron and hole pockets present

- Nematic phase: _anisotropic Fermi surface_
- Also affects _symmetry of superconducting gap_
- Indication of pairing mechanism: flat $d_{xy}$ band shifts towards $E_{F}$ as supercoductivity is enhanced by $\ce{ Te }$ substitution

- Magnetic field: quantum oscillations
- Measuring quantum oscillations under high pressure (tetragonal phase)
- Gives quasiparticle effective mass (orbital averaged for each pocket)

- Different superconducucting phases tuned by pressure
