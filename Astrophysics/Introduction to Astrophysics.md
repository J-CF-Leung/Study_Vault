- Distances
	- Nearby objects: stellar parallax (astrometry)
	- Far objects: brightness (photometry)
	- Distant objects: redshift and Hubble's law

- Masses: Newton/Kepler's Laws + _velocity_ measurements
	- Or gravitational lensing
- Velocities: Spectrograph/Doppler shift

- Radius of _Earth's orbit_: 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) = $1.496\times 10^{11}\,\text{m}$
- Sun and moon: 0.5 arcminutes in the sky
- Parsec: distance from the Sun of an object such that the _radius of Earth's orbit_ subtends 1 arcsecond at the object = 206265 AU
- Mass of sun: $1.989\times 10^{30}\,\text{kg}$
- Radius of the Sun: $6.96\times 10^{8}Â \,\text{m}$

- _Brightness_: apparent magnitude
$$m_\lambda=-2.5\log_{10}F+\text{const.}$$
- A _fainter_ object has a _numerically bigger_ magnotide
- $F$: _Flux_ in some wavelength interval/waveband/passband
- Constant: take some _standard star_, define $m_\lambda=0$
	- Standard star: _Vega_
- $2.5$: ancient convention

- The _apparent magnitudes_ are written using a letter referring to the _passband_
![[magnitude passbands.png]]
- The measure of _colour_ are obtained by taking _differences between magnitude measurements_
	- Differences are _flux ratios_
- _Interstellar dust_ in the _line of sight_ can make stars seem _dimmer_, as well as _redder_ due to _scattering_
- A _cluster_ of stars will have _constant reddening_

- The _absolute magnitude_: magnitude the star would have when observed from a _distance of_ $10\,\text{pc}$

- _Stellar parallax_: distance measurement _independent on brightness_
![[Stellar parallax.png]]
	- If star moves elliptically, path in sky looks like _helix_
	- Limit: $\approx50\,\text{pc}$
	- Limit of accuracy using _satellite_ $\approx 10\,\mu-\text{arcsec}$
	- Largest stellar parallax: $0.77\,\text{arcsec}$

- Distance modulus:
$$m-M=-2.5\log_{10}\frac{F_d}{F_{10}}=-2.5\log_{10}\left(\frac{10}{d}\right)^2$$
$$d=$$
- Given $d$, one can _calculate_ $M$
- This establishes _standard candles_

- _Cephid variable stars_ have a _periodic luminosity_

- _Hubble's law_ states that the _recession velocity_ of an object (measured from spectra) is _proportional to distance_:
$$v=H_0d \hspace{1.5cm}d=\frac{v}{H_0}=\frac{cz}{H_0}$$
- $z$ is the _redshift_
- For a _large redshift_, one must make _relativistic corrections_

- The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram:
	- _Logarithmic_ axes for _stellar surface temperature_ and _stellar luminosity_
![[Gaia HR diagram.png|500]]
- An _evolutionary track_ of a star represents its time-evolution
	- Example: _Hayashi tracks_ for stars of a _given mass_ moving _towards main sequence_
	- To the _right_ of the Hayashi tracks, stars are _unstable_ and _collapse_
- An _isochrone_ represents a sequence of stars of _different masses_ but with the _same age/initial composition_

- Temperature measurements: _surface spectra_ + accounting for _reddening_

- Luminosity measurements: _absolute magnitude_, estimated from the _spectra_
- _Giant_ stars have _narrower_ hydrogen spectral lines
- Luminosity $L\propto R^2T^4$
