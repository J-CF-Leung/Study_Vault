All from the wonderful and amazing book, An Introduction to Classical Mechanics, by David Morin

## Scams
The ad said, For one little fee, 
You can skip all that course-work ennui. 
So send your tuition, 
For boundless fruition! 
Get your mail-order physics degree!

## Problem solving strategy
a is dv by dt. 
Is this useful? There’s no guarantee.
If it leads to “Oh, heck!”’s, 
Take dv by dx, 
And then write down its product with v.

## Galileo
What would you have thought, Galileo,
 If instead you dropped cows and did say, “Oh! 
 To lessen the sound 
 Of the moos from the ground, 
 They should fall not through air, but through mayo!”

## Superposition
For equations with one main condition 
(Those linear), we give you permission 
To take your solutions, 
With firm resolutions, 
And add them in superposition.

## Equation solving strategy
This is our method, essential, 
For equations we solve, differential. 
It gets the job done, 
And it’s even quite fun. 
We just try a routine exponential.

## Harmonic approximation
A potential may look quite erratic, 
And its study may seem problematic. 
But down near a min, 
You can say with a grin, 
“It behaves like a simple quadratic!”

## Minimal action
It just stood there and did nothing, of course, 
A harmless and still wooden horse. 
But the minimal action 
Was just a distraction. 
The plan involved no use of force.

## A particle takes all possible paths
When walking, I know that my aim 
Is caused by the ghosts with my name. 
And although I don’t see 
Where they walk next to me, 
I know they’re all there, just the same.

## Noether's Theorem
As Noether most keenly observed 
(And for which much acclaim is deserved), 
We can easily see, 
That for each symmetry, 
A quantity must be conserved.

## Effective potentials
When using potentials, effective, 
Remember the one main objective: 
The goal is to shun 
All dimensions but one, 
And then view things with 1-D perspective.

## The 1/r potential
Newton said as he gazed off afar, 
“From here to the most distant star, 
These wond’rous ellipses 
And solar eclipses 
All come from a 1 over r.”

## Space exploration
As we grow up, we open an ear, 
Exploring the cosmic frontier. 
In this coming of age, 
We turn in our cage, 
All alone on a tiny blue sphere.

## Torque
For conditions that number but three, 
We say, “Torque is dL by dt.” 
But though they’re all true, 
I’ll stick to just two; 
It’s CM’s and fixed points for me.

## The guessing game
What L was, he just couldn’t tell. 
And p? He was clueless as well. 
But despite his distress, 
He wrote down the right guess 
For their quotient: the lever-arm’s $l$.

## Parity
When studying vectors in school, 
You’ll use your right hand as a tool. 
But look in a mirror, 
And then you’ll see clearer, 
You can just use the left-handed rule.

## Fictitious forces
As Einstein explored elevators, 
And studied the spinning ice-skaters, 
He eyed as suspicious, 
The forces fictitious, 
Of gravity’s great imitators.

## Coriolis force
On a merry-go-round in the night, 
Coriolis was shaken with fright. 
Despite how he walked, 
’Twas like he was stalked 
By some fiend always pushing him right.

## Copernicus
Copernicus gave his reply 
To those who had pledged to deny. 
“All your addictions 
To ancient convictions 
Won’t bring back your place in the sky.”

## Loss of simultaneity
Of the many effects, miscellaneous, 
The loss of events, simultaneous, 
Allows A to claim 
There’s no pause in B’s frame,




Where this last line is not so extraneous

## Time dilation
The effects of dilation of time 
Are magical, strange, and sublime. 
In your frame, this verse, 
Which you’ll see is not terse, 
Can be read in the same amount of time it takes someone else in another frame to read a similar sort of rhyme.

## Length contraction
Relativistic limericks have the attraction
Of being shrunk by a Lorentz contraction. 
But for readers, unwary, 
The results may be scary, 
When a fraction . . .

## Relativistic muons
Observe that for muons, created, 
The dilation of time is related 
To Einstein’s insistence 
Of shrunken-down distance
In the frame where decays aren’t belated.

## Lorentz transformations
The excitement will build in your voice, 
As you rise from your seat and rejoice, 
“A Lorentz transformation 
Provides confirmation 
Of my alternate method of choice!”

## Proving
Consider, when seeking gestalts, 
The theories that physics exalts. 
It’s not that they’re known 
To be written in stone. 
It’s just that we can’t say they’re false.

## Primes
“To three, five, and seven, assign 
A name,” the prof said, “We’ll define.” 
But he botched the instruction 
With woeful induction 
And told us the next prime was nine.

## The non-relativistic limit
Whether abstract, profound, or just mystic, 
Or boring, or somewhat simplistic, 
A theory must lead 
To results that we need 
In limits, nonrelativistic.

## Relativistic Newton's Laws
They said, “F is ma, bar none.” 
What they meant sounded not as much fun. 
It’s dp by dt, 
Which just happens to be 
Good ol’ “ma” when γ is 1.

## Getting heavier
“Force is my a times my ‘mass’,” 
Said the driver, when starting to pass. 
But from what we’ve just learned, 
He was right when he turned, 
But wrong when he stepped on the gas.

## Physical laws
God said to his cosmos directors, 
“I’ve added some stringent selectors. 
One is the clause
That your physical laws 
Shall be written in terms of 4-vectors.”

## General Relativity
Greetings! Dear brother from Boulder, 
I hear that you’ve gotten much older. 
And please tell me why 
My lower left thigh 
Hasn’t aged quite as much as my shoulder

## Dimensional analysis
“Your units are wrong!” cried the teacher. 
“Your church weighs six joules — what a feature! 
And the people inside 
Are four hours wide, 
And eight gauss away from the preacher!”

## Limiting cases
The lemmings get set for their race. 
With one step and two steps they pace. 
They take three and four, 
And then head on for more, 
Without checking the limiting case.

## Numerical methods
The skill to do math on a page 
Has declined to the point of outrage. 
Equations quadratica 
Are solved on Math’matica, 
And on birthdays we don’t know our age

## Hermitian matrices
God’s first tries were hardly ideal, 
For complex worlds have no appeal. 
So in the present edition, 
He made things Hermitian, 
And this world, it seems, is quite real.
