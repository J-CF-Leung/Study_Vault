- Groups of _finite order_

# Cyclic groups
- The $n$th order _cyclic group_ can be generated by a _single element_ $g$ (the _generator_), where:
$$g^n=I$$
- The _group elements_ are:
$$\{I,g,g^2,\dots,g^{n-1}\}$$
- The group is _Abelian_
- The [[Foundations of Group Theory#Presentations|presentation]] of $Z_n$ is:
$$Z_n:\braket{g|g^n=I}$$

- For _any_ group $G$, one can form a _cyclic subgroup_ with some element $g$
	- Trivially, if $G=Z_n$, the cyclic subgroup is $G$ itself

- The _set of integers_ $\mathbb{Z}$, under _addition_, forms the _infinite cyclic group_
	- The generator is simply $1$
- The set of integers _modulo_ $n$ under addition is [[Foundations of Group Theory#Mappings|isomorphic]] to $Z_n$
- The $n$th roots of $1$ form a group under _multiplication_, isomorphic to $Z_n$

# The Vierergruppe
- The Vierergruppe/Klein four-group has 4 _self-inverse_ elements
- Composing _any two non-identity_ elements gives the _third non-identity_ element
- The group is also _Abelian_

- The _presentation_ is:
$$V:\braket{A,B|A^2=B^2=I, AB=BA}$$
- This group is also given by $Z_2\otimes Z_2$
	- It has elements $(1,1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(1,1)$

- _Any fourth-order_ group is _isomorphic_ to either $Z_4$ or $V$

# Permutation Groups
- The _permutation groups_ $S_n$ is rearranges $n$ objects, and evidently has $n!$ elements
	- The _subgroup_ $A_n$ only has the _even permutations_

- An important theorem in group theory related to permutation groups:
>[!info] Cayley's Theorem
> _All_ finite groups are _isomorphic to a subgroup_ of $S_n$

- A row in the [[Foundations of Group Theory#Multiplication tables|multiplication table]] of some group $G$ with elements $\{g_1,g_2,\dots,g_n\}$ will have products $\{g_ig_1,g_ig_2,\dots,g_ig_n\}$, which from the _once and only once_ rule, must be _some permutation_ of the elements of $G$
- Hence, $g_i$ can be _mapped onto_ a subgroup of the permutation group 
	- $(n<n!)$, especially for _large $n$_

- Example: 
	- $Z_2$ is isomorphic to $S_2$ 
	- $Z_3$ is isomorphic to $A_3$, a _subgroup_ of $S_3$

## Cycles and transpositions
- An _element_ of the permutation group $S_5$ can be written as:
$$g=\pmatrix{1&2&3&4&5 \\ 4&1&5&2&3}$$
- This permutation takes: $1\to 5$, $2\to1$, and so forth
- It can also be said that it _cyclically permutes_ $1\to4\to2\to1$ and $3\to5\to3$
- This suggests a _compact notation_:
$$g=(142)(35)$$
- In other words, the permutation consists of a _3-cycle_ and a _2-cycle_
	- 2-cycles are also known as _transpositions_

- _Any_ permutation $P$ can be _resolved_ into cycles of various lengths, with _no cycle containing any number in common_
	- A _1-cycle_ means leaving a number _unchanged_
	- Proof: _construct_ a cycle, and if there are numbers left over, construct another cycle until the entire permutation is resolved
- 1-cycles are usually _omitted_:
$$g=\pmatrix{1&2&3&4&5 \\ 1&5&3&4&2}\longrightarrow g=(25)$$

- _Any_ $n-$cycle, with $n>2$, can be _written as a product of transpositions_:
	- In the above example, $(142)=(14)(42)$
- Properties of products:
	- If 2-cycles _have no numbers in common_, they _commute_ (Example: $(12)(34)=(34)(12)$)
	- $(ab)(ba)=I$
	- $(ab)(bc)(cd)=(abcd)$
	- $(abc)(cde)=(abcde)$

- All 2-cycles are _odd_, and hence all 3-cycles are _even_, and so on
- Then, a permutation is _even or odd_ if it _decomposes_ into an _even or odd number of exchanges/transpositions_

- This leads to the theorem that _all groups of even order_ have _at least one element_ $g$ with order 2, or in other words, $g^2=I$

## Cycle structure
- Let a permutation in $S_n$ be witten as a product of $n_j$ $j-$cycles:
$$\sum_j jn_j=n$$
- _Given_ a cycle structure with integers $\{n_j\}$, the _number of such permutations_ in $S_n$:
$$\mathcal{N}(n_1,\dots,n_j,\dots)=\frac{n!}{\prod_j j^{n_j}n_j!}$$
- These cycle structures correspond to _partitions_ of the integer $n$

# The dihedral group
- The _dihedral group_ $D_n$ is the set of _transformations_ leaving an _$n-$sided regular polygon_ invariant
	- Also known as $C_{nv}$ in [[Symmetry in molecules|physical chemistry]]
- The group is _generated_ by:
	- _Rotation_ $R$ by angle $2\pi/n$
	- _Reflection_ $r$ through a _median_ of the polygon
- For _odd_ $n$, each median goes through a _vertex_ and the _midpoint_ of one side
- For _even_ $n$, $n/2$ medians go through a _vertex_, and $n/2$ go through 2 _midpoints_

- The _orders_ of $R$ and $r$:
$$R^{n}=I \hspace{1cm} r^2=I$$

- The _inverse_ of a rotation $R^{-1}$ can be generated by $R^{n-1}$ or $rRr$
	- A _reflected_ rotation is the same as a _rotation in the opposite direction_
	- From this, one can obtain $R^jr=rR^{n-j}$
- Hence, $D_n$ has $2n$ elements:
$$\{I,R,R^2,\dots,R^{n-1},r,Rr,R^2r,\dots,R^{n-1}r\}$$
- The _presentation_ of $D_n$ is:
$$D_n=\braket{R,r|R^n=I,r^2=I,Rr=rR^{-1}}$$

# The quarterionic group
- The _quaternions_ obey the rules:
$$\displaylines{i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1 \\ ij=-ji=k \hspace{1cm} jk=-kj=i \hspace{1cm} ki=-ik=j}$$
- The _quarternionic group_ $\mathcal{Q}$ is composed of 8 elements:
$$\{1,-1,i,-i,j,-j,k,-k\}$$
	- These 8 elements form a _group under multiplication_

# Coxeter groups
- A Coxeter group is represented by:
$$\braket{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_k|(a_i)^2=I,(a_ia_j)^{n_{ij}}=I,n_{ij}\geq2, \text{ with }i,j=1,2,\dots,k}$$
- Each _generator_ (not element) _squares to the identity_
- For every _pair of generators_, there exists an _integer_ $n_{ij}$ such that $(a_ia_j)^{n_{ij}}=I$

- Each _generator_ corresponds to _reflection_

- By associativity, it can be shown that $n_{ij}=n_{ji}$
	- $I=b^2=b(ab)^nb=(ba)^n$
