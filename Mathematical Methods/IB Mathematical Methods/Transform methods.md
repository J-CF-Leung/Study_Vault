- This is the _application_ of methods from [[Elementary Analysis|Complex Analysis]] and [[Contour integration]] to [[Fourier series and transforms|Fourier transforms]]
- _Define_ the Fourier transform as:
$$\tilde{f}(k)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\exp(-ikx)\,dx$$
- Then define the _inverse Fourier transform_:
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde{f}(k)\exp(ikx)\,dk$$
- These can be interpreted as _contour integrals along the real axis_ in the complex $x-$ and $k-$planes
