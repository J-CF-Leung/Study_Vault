- Spectroscopy: _Determining structures using the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter_

## Physical principles and approximations

- Contributions to the energy of a molecule are: 
	- Translation (_ignored_ as light does not significantly affect motion)
	- Vibration
	- Rotation
	- Electronic

- These energies are _quantised_
- The _energy level spacing_ for the different contributions are _on very different scales_
- With the [[Molecular quantum mechanics#The Born-Oppenheimer approximation|Born-Oppenheimer approximation]], the different contributions can be regarded as _independent of each other_
- Thus, the energy level _transitions are also independent_:
$$\displaylines{\Delta E_\text{tot}=\Delta E_\text{elec}+\Delta E_\text{vib}+\Delta E_\text{rot}}$$
