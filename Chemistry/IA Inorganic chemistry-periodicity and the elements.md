## Effective nuclear charge
- Definition: $$E=-\frac{Z_{eff}^2R_H}{n^2}$$
- $Z_{eff}<Z$ due to shielding
- High $Z_{eff}$ leads to compact, lower energy orbitals, and vice versa
- Trends in orbital energy:
	- Across period: orbital energy is lowered
	- Down a group: Increase in $Z_{eff}$  offset by increase in $n$
- Effectiveness of shielding:
	- s>p>d>f (more angular nodes)
	- Shielding is weak in the same shell
	- Shielding gets weaker as orbitals get further from the nucleus
- Periodicity of $Z_{eff}$:
	- Increases across a period as electrons in the valence orbital don't shield each other well
	- From period 4, there is a large increase across the period as the d-orbitals are filled
	- From period 6, as f-orbitals are filled, the increase is even more significant

## Penetration and relativistic effects
### Penetration
- Orbitals with higher principal quantum number have regions of electron density near the nucleus, and experience a higher $Z_{eff}$ despite shielding
- Example: 4s and 3d
	- 4s penetrates closer to the nucleus, and has a lower energy than 3d for 1<Z<21, hence it gets filled first despite $\langle r_{4s}\rangle<\langle r_{3d} \rangle$
	- As the 3d starts to get filled, its energy falls sharply as the 4s does not shield it effectively, therefore ionisation occurs first in the 4s
### Relativistic effects
- For heavier elements, as electrons move faster, they experience length contraction, resulting in a decrease in orbital radius and energy
- s-orbitals experience the effects more than other orbitals due to the wave-function being non-zero at the nucleus
- d and f orbitals experience some destabilisation from repulsion with contracted s and p orbitals
- Starts being quite significant at n=6

## Periodicity
### Orbital energies
- Generally decreases across a period as $Z_{eff}$ increases with constant $n$
- Decrease down a group is offset by increase in $n$
- Drops off dramatically after the orbital is fully filled and no longer shielded
- K -> Zn: $E_{4s}$ does not decrease significantly due to shielding from 3d, drops dramatically after Ga
- s-p separation increases across a period as the s orbital penetrates more than p
- s-p separation decreases down a group as p orbital also penetrates, and there are more electrons between the nucleus and valence shell
- s-p separation increases again at n=6 due to relativistic effects

### Atomic radii
- Definitions: 
	- Covalent radius- half of $\ce{A-A}$ bond length (or estimated from $\ce{A-E}$ bond length, depenent on oxidation state)
	- Metallic radius- half of internuclear distance in a lattice, dependent on packing
	- Ionic radius- radius in lattice, ignores covalent character and depends on charge. oxidation state and coordination number
	- van der Waals radius- half of nearest contact distance where only dispersion forces are significant
- Across a period:
	- Decrease in radius due to $Z_{eff}$
	- More significant decrease from $n=4$ due to the filling of poorly shielding d-orbitals (d-block contraction)
- Down a group:
	- Increase in radius due to increasing $n$
	- Much smaller increase stating from $n=4$ due to d-block contraction, f-block contraction, and relativistic effects, leading to a small decrease in some cases

### Ionisation energy
- Across a period
	- Generally reflects the increase in $Z_{eff}$
	- For elements with half-full or full electronic configurations (e.g. B, N, Ne), there is a spike in ionisation energy due to electron pairing energy in the unionised atom
	- Lower ionisation energy for O/S, F/Cl, Ne/Ar due to small decrease in pairing energy after ionisation
- Down a group
	- Generally decreases to reflect the increase in $n$
	- Much smaller decrease/slight increase starting from $n=4$ due to d- and f-block contraction, and relativistic effects
	- Significant increase also seen in 5d transition metals (6s is being removed, and experiences f-block contraction and relativistic effects)
### Electron affinity
- +ve: energy released when electron is added, exothermic (favourable)
- Most values are positive as attraction to electron is more dominant
- Adding electron to atoms with half or fully filled shells is not as favourable (-ve electron affinity)
- Generally increases across a period due to higher $Z_{eff}$
- Down the group: Variable, depends on contraction effects (contraction leads to dense electron cloud and repulsion, as well as stabilisation of the electron)
- Second period: smaller electron affinities due to compact orbitals
- Gold: 6s$^1$, extra electron stabilised, resulting in high electron affinity

### Electronegativity
- Provides scale of bond polarity
	- In a polar covalent bond, the electronegative atom has an orbital energy close to bonding MO
- Hard atom: electronegative, small and compact orbitals, wide bonding-antibonding $\Delta E$
- Increases across a period due to rise in $Z_{eff}$
- Decreases down a group as valence orbitals get further from nucleus
- Elements in 4p period: higher electronegativity than expected due to d-block contraction, with effect diminishing across period
- After period 4: "Flattening", as contraction is balanced by increase in shielding
- Covalent/metallic character:
	- Low electronegativity: metallic character as electrons tend to be delocalised
	- High electronegativity: compact orbitals, tendency to form covalent bonds
	- Result: More metallic character down a group

## Oxidation states
- Oxidation states: Formal number of electrons added to, or removed from atom
- Valence states: number of electrons actually used in bonding
	- Two are not necessarily equal
### Factors affecting oxidation state
- Thermodynamic stability of ion is a balance between:
	- Ionisation energy/electron affinity
	- Bond energy/lattice energy with other atoms
		- Strong covalent bonds: Hard/hard or soft/soft
		- Atom with high oxidation state: stabilised by hard atom with low-energy valence electron/ need a high lattice energy
- Limit on oxidation state is given by electronic configuration
### Periodicity of oxidation states
- s-block: predominant oxidation state=+group number
	- Electropositive, almost exclusiely ionic
	- Group 1 can form -1 oxidation states
- p-block: range of positive oxidation states from 0 to $n_s+n_p$
	- Inert pair effect: p-block elements at the top prefer $n_s+n_p$, elements at the bottom prefer $+n_p$
		- Top: high ionisation/promotion energy, but compact orbitals give high bond energy
		- Bottom: low ionisation/promotion energy, diffuse orbitals form weak bonds
		- Relativistic effect: use of $s$ electrons is less favourable
- d-block: Large variation
	- High availability of electrons, first lost from s-block
	- Increase of $Z_{eff}$ across the period leads to higher ionisation energies
	- "Hump" behaviour for highest oxidation states
	- 4d and 5d elements: higher oxidation states due to higher energy orbitals
	- Ionic compounds with metals in lower oxidation states (e.g. $\ce{WF2}$) are stable with respect to elements, but not compounds with higher oxidation states
		- Example: $\ce{WF2}$ disproportionates into $\ce{W}$ and $\ce{WF5}$
