# Chemical potential
- The chemical potential $\mu$ is defined by the differential relation for change in internal energy:
$$dU=TdS-pdV+\mu dN$$
- For more than one type of particle, the relation becomes:
$$dU=TdS-pdV+\sum \mu_i dN_i$$
- In terms of the three [[Classical Thermodynamics#Thermodynamic potentials|thermodynamic potentials]], $U, F$, and $G$:
$$\mu=\left(\pd{U}{N}\right)_{S,V}=\left(\pd{F}{N}\right)_{T,V}=\left(\pd{G}{N}\right)_{T,p}$$
- For two systems at equal temperatures, able to exchange particles, $S$ is maximised when $\mu_1=\mu_2$
	- Analagous to role of temperature in energy exchange
- Gibbs energy per particle
