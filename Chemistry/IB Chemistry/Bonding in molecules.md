- Bonding relies heavily on the [[Symmetry in molecules]]

# Qualitative MO Diagrams
- MOs are mainly obtained from the _linear combination of atomic orbitals_ (LCAO) method, based on the [[Molecular quantum mechanics#The Variational Principle|Variational Principle]]
- However, some linear combinations may _not be symmetry allowed_ as they have [[Symmetry in molecules#Overlap integrals|zero overlap]]

- Overall, it is a better strategy to _classify orbitals according to symmetry_, creating _symmetry orbitals_, which then overlap to create MOs

## Basic properties

### Two atomic orbitals
- When two AOs interact, they form a _bonding_ MO which is _lower in energy_ then both of the AOs, airising from _in-phase overlap_
- They also form an _antibonding_ MO which is _higher in energy_ than both AOs, arising from _out of phase overlap_

- The _greater the energy separation_ between the AOs, the _smaller the shift in energy_ between the _lower AO_ and the _bonding MO_, and likewise for the higher energy orbitals

- The _greater contribution_ to the MO is _from the AO closest to it in energy_
![[AOs overlapping.png]]

### More atomic orbitals
- If there are _several AOs_ interacting, the _number of MOs is the same as number of AOs_

- _One_ MO will lie _lower in energy than the lowest energy AO_
- Likewise, _one_ MO will be _higher in energy than the highest energy AO_
- All other MOs will _lie between both extremes_

- The _greatest contribution_ to each MO is still _from the AO closest in energy_
![[Many MOs.png]]

- When _sketching_ MOs, one can _shade_ MOs to indicate _phase_, and use _size_ to indicate _contribution_

## Symmetry orbitals
- A _symmetry orbital_ (SO) is a _linear combination_ of other orbitals, such that it _transforms as a single irreducible representation_

- The method:
1. Find the _point group_ the molecule transforms as
2. Choose a _set of AOs_ to construct SOs from, typically all _from the same type of atom_
3. Find the _representation_ they collectively transform as
4. _Reduce_ the representation
5. _Construct_ orbitals that transform as each _irreducible representation_, based on _analogies with Cartesian functions_
6. _Normalise_ the orbitals

- The reducible representation commonly includes the _totally symmetric IR_, which would involve _all orbitals in phase_

- For _multi-dimensional irreducible representations_, one will need to construct a _set of symmetry orbitals_, each of which transform as one dimension of the IR

### Example: BH3
- Point group: $D_{3h}$
![[D3h character table.png]]
- Start with the _three hydrogen $1s$ orbitals_
![[BH3 hydrogen orbitals.png]]
- It can be found that these three orbitals transform as $A_1'\oplus E'$

- $A_1'$ is the _totally symmetric_ IR, so it involves _all orbitals combined in-phase_
- $E'$ is a _two-dimensional IR_, so it produces _one SO transforming like $x$_, and _one SO transforming like $y$_
- This gives the three orbitals: 
$$\displaylines{\theta_{A_1'}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(s_A+s_B+s_C) \\ \theta_{E',x}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(s_B-s_C) \\ \theta_{E',y}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(2s_A-s_B-s_C)}$$
![[BH3 hydrogen SOs.png|450]]

- Next, there are the $2s$ along with three $2p$ _boron AOs_
- The $2s$ orbital transforms as $A_1'$
- The $2p_z$ transforms as $A_2''$, while $(2p_x,2p_y)$ transforms as $E'$

- Then, _SOs with the same symmetry overlap_ to produce corresponding _bonding and anti-bonding orbitals_
- Meanwhile, as $\text{B } 2p_z$ is the only one with $A_2''$ symmetry, it produces a _non-bonding orbital_
![[BH3 SO overlap.png|600]]

- Overall, the _totally symmetric_ IR gives MOs that give _more overlap_
	- Can be justified with the [[#HÃ¼ckel Approximations]]
- Then, one can make this _qualitative MO diagram_
![[BH3 MO diagram.png|500]]

### Example: BF3 and local coordinate systems
- Depending on the _symmetry_ of a molecule, instead of a coordinate system applying to all molecules, one can use _local_ coordinates for each atom

- In $\text{BF}_3$, using a universal one, the $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ AOs of different $\text{F}$ atoms _do not transform into each other_
![[BF3 universal coords.png]]

- Instead, classify them into _radial_ and _tangential_ sets:
![[BF3 local coords.png]]

- Constructing symmetry orbitals then proceeds as normal:
![[BF3 example SOs.png]]

## Projection operator
- Symmetry orbitals may not necessarily form an analogy with _Cartesian functions_
- Example: $2p$ orbitals on $\text{BF}_3$
![[BF3 SO.png|350]]

- Let the set of basis orbitals be $\{\phi_i\}$, typically being AOs
- Let the SO transforming as IR $k$ be $\theta^{(k)}$
- The SO can be found by applying the _projection operator_ $\hat{P}^{(k)}$ to a basis function:
$$\displaylines{\theta^{(k)}=\hat{P}^{(k)}\phi_i \\ \hat{P}^{(k)}=\frac{1}{n_R}\sum_R[\chi^{(k)}(R)]\hat{R}}$$
- $\hat{R}$ is a _symmetry operation_ in the group, $n_R$ is the _number of operations_, and $\chi$ is the _character_ of the operation in the representation $k$

- The sum is over _operations_, so operations _in the same class_ must be considered _separately_
- If a basis orbital is _not present in the SO_, then the operator gives _zero_

# Transition metal complexes
- _Transition metals_ can form many _coordination compounds/complexes_
- There is a _central metal atom_ surrounded by a number of _ligands_, which are often _anions_ or _small molecules_
- The ligands have a _ligating atom_ which _interacts directly_ with the metal

- Considering the _central atom_ and the _ligating atoms_, they often have a _high amount of symmetry_

- Common types:
	- _Octahedral_, often with point group $O_h$
	- _Square planar_, often with point group $D_{4h}$
	- _Tetrahedral_, often with point group $T_d$

## Octahedral complexes with $\sigma$ donors
- Consider an _octahedral complex_, where the _central metal ion_ $\text{M}^{n+}$ is surrounded by _six identical ligands_ $\text{L}$, each directing a _$\sigma-$type orbital towards the metal_
- Typically, these orbitals are occupied by _lone pairs_, such as in $\text{NH}_3$ or $\text{H}_2\text{O}$
- In this case, one can _ignore the bonding in the ligand itself_

- Inspect the _character table_ for $O_h$:
	![[Oh character table.png]]
	- There are _four_ $C_3$ axes, each generating 2 rotations, and also doubling as $S_6$ axes
	- The _principal_ $C_4$ axes are _along the ligands_, and are also $S_4$ axes
	- The $C_2$ axes _bisect_ the $\text{L-M-L}$ bond angles
	- The $\sigma_d$ planes contain 2 $\text{M-L}$ bonds and _bisect_ $\text{L-M-L}$
	- The $\sigma_h$ planes contain 4 $\text{M-L}$ bonds

- For _first-row transition metals_, the $3s$ and $3p$ orbitals are _too contracted_ to interact significantly with ligand orbitals
- Instead, the $3d$, $4s$, and $4p$ contribute to bonding
- Their irreducible representations are:
| Cartesian function       | Corresponding orbital(s)      | Irreducible representation     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| $(x^2+y^2+z^2)$          | $4s$                          | Totally symmetric IR, $A_{1g}$ |
| $(x,y,z)$                | $4p_x$,$4p_y$,$4p_z$          | $T_{1u}$                       |
| $(xy,yz,xz)$             | $3d_{xy}$,$3d_{yz}$,$3d_{xz}$ | $T_{2g}$                       |
| $(2z^2-x^2-y^2,x^2-y^2)$ | $3d_{z^2}$,$3d_{x^2-y^2}$     | $E_g$                               |

- Meanwhile, the six $\sigma$ orbitals reduce to:
$$A_{1g}\oplus E_g\oplus T_{1u}$$

![[Oh sigma orbitals.png|600]]

- Allowing orbitals of _the same symmetry_ to overlap:
![[Sigma octahedral complex.png]]

- There are _$6$ bonding orbitals_, which are mainly _ligand-derived_
- There are $5$ orbitals, mainly _derived from metal $3d$ orbitals_
- There are $4$ _anti-bonding orbitals_, which have the _greatest contribution from metal_ $4s$ and $4p$ orbitals

- Each ligand is _assumd to donate two electrons each_
- So for first-row transition metal ions, $1t_{2g}$ and $2e_g$ are _filled by electrons originating from the metal $3d$ orbital_

## Ligand field splitting
- The _energy splitting_ between the $1t_{2g}$ and $2e_g$ orbitals is known as the _ligand-field splitting_, denoted $\Delta_o$
	- $o$ stands for _octahedral_, as its nature depends on the shape of the complex
- It is an energy difference between a _non-bonding set_ of MOs and _an anti-bonding set_
- Hence, its magnitude _depends on strength of the bonding interaction_

- Typically, as the $3d$ and $\sigma$ orbitals become _closer in energy_, and the bond strength increases, hence the _splitting increases_
	- This occurs when the _oxidation state of the metal increases_, _contracting the $3d$
	- This can also occur when _moving across the row_ of transition metals, as the _nuclear charge_ contracts the orbitals
- It can also depend on _ligand type_ (See [[#Effect of $ pi$ interactions]])

## High- and low-spin complexes
- As the _bonding_ orbitals have to be completely filled, each orbital contains a _spin singlet_
- If a set of orbitals are _partially occupied_, then each existing _electron pair of the same spin_ will _lower the total energy_ by an [[Molecular quantum mechanics#Coulomb and exchange integrals|exchange term]] $K$

- For the _partially filled_ $1t_{2g}$ and $2e_g$ orbitals, the _spin orientations_ can depend on the _magnitude of splitting_:
![[High spin low spin.png]]

- If the splitting $\Delta_o<3K$, then electrons will be _promoted_ to $2e_g$ to _maximise the number of paired spins_, and achieve _lower energy_
- If the splitting $\Delta_o>3K$, then electrons will _stay at $1t_{2g}$_ to minimise energy
- For all numbers of $d$ electrons:
![[High spin low spin energies.png|600]]

- The magnitude of splitting can be _inferred_ from _electronic spectroscopy_
- Overall, _promoting_ and electron will _alter the energy of all orbitals_ due to changes in repulsion, so more _calculations_ are needed other than the readings themselves

### Magnetic properties
- The overall _magnetic properties_ can easily be _interpreted_ to give whether a complex is _high spin_ or _low spin_
- Any _unpaired electrons_ will lead to the complex being [[Electromagnetism#Magnetic permeability in materials|paramagnetic]]
- The _magnetic susceptibility_ is _proportional_ to the _effective magnetic moment_:
$$\mu_\text{eff}=2\sqrt{S(S+1)}=\sqrt{n(n+2)}$$
- This magnetic moment is measured in terms of _Bohr magnetons_:
$$\mu_B=\frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$$
- $S$ is the _total spin_, and $n$ is the _number of unpaired electrons_

- A _high spin_ complex will give a _higher degree of paramagnetism_


### Thermodynamic properties
- When plotting _hydration_ and _lattice_ enthalpies, as a function of _number of $d$ electrons_, one will notice a _double dip_:
![[Hydration and lattice enthalpies.png|600]]
- These are interpreted as the _enthalpy of formation of complexes_

- As the _atomic number_ of the metal _increases_, the $3d$ orbital _contracts_, strengthening the bond and _lowering the energy of the bonding electrons_ in the complex
- Let the _energy decrease_ of the bonding electrons be $-E_L$

- However, assuming a _high spin_ complex, increasing the number of $d$ electrons also _increases the number $2e_{g}$ electrons_ $n_{e_\sigma}$
	- This does _not_ occur for _all numbers of_ $d$ electrons 
- Hence, the _overall energy change_ is:
$$-E_L+n_{e_\sigma}E_\sigma$$
- Therefore, the _form_ of the overall hydration/lattice enthalpy is:
![[Hydration enthalpy origin.png]]
- This gives the _double dip_

## Effect of $\pi$ interactions
- Many ligands also have _$\pi$ orbitals_ that may be suitable to _overlap with the metal orbitals_
- Example: For atomic _anions_, there will be $p$ _orbitals perpendicular to the $\text{M}-\text{L}$ axis_
![[Ligand p orbitals.png|200]]

- If there is a _pair_ of $p$ orbitals _perpendicular to the $\text{M}-\text{L}$ axis_, then the 12 orbitals have the _representation_:
$$T_{1g}\oplus T_{2g}\oplus T_{1u}\oplus T_{2u}$$
- In general, there are two types:
	- $\pi$ _donors_, where the $\pi$ orbitals are at a _similar energy_ to the $\sigma$ orbitals
	- $\pi$ _acceptors_, where the $\pi$ orbitals are at a _higher energy_ than the $\sigma$ orbitals

### Donors
- $\pi$ donor ligands often contain _bonding_ $\pi$ orbitals that can overlap with the metal $3d$
	- Example: $\text{Cl}^-$ _anion_
- By considering the effect of _adding_ the $T_{2g}$ orbitals at a _similar energy level_ to the _$\sigma$ orbitals_:
![[Sigma and pi donor.png]]

- Overall, the _lower_ $T_{2g}$ orbitals cause a _weak overlap_
- The $1t_{2g}$ orbitals are _bonding_, and are often _filled_ (depending on the ligand)
- This will cause a _decrease in ligand field splitting_

### Acceptors
- $\pi$ acceptor ligands often contain _antibonding_ $\pi^*$ orbitals that can overlap with the metal $3d$
	- Example: $\text{CO}$ $\pi^*$
- By considering the effect of _adding_ the $T_{2g}$ orbitals at a _higher energy level_ than the _$\sigma$ and the $3d$ orbitals_:
![[Sigma and pi acceptor.png]]

- Overall, the higher energy of the $T_{2g}$ orbitals cause a _weak overlap_
- The _weakly bonding_ $1t_{2g}$ orbital is _partially occupied_ by _metal electrons_
- This causes an _increase in ligand field splitting_

### Spectrochemical series 
- For a _given metal and oxidation state_, changing the _ligand_ changes the magnitude of $\Delta_o$

- The _magnitude_ of $\Delta_o$ _increases_ from left to right along the _spectrochemical series_:
![[Spectrochemical series.png]]

- Generally, a _strong_ $\sigma$ _interaction_ will lead to a large value of $\Delta_o$
	- This means a _higher energy $\sigma$ donor orbital_ to make a _better match_
	- Hence, as _ligating atom_ changes from $\text{N}$ to $\text{O}$ to $\text{C}$, $\Delta_o$ increases

### The 18-electron rule
- For an octahedral complex with $\pi$ _acceptors_, there are _$9$ bonding MOs_
- Hence, when there are $18$ _valence electrons_, this _maximises degree of bonding_

- This leads to an _18-electron "rule"_, where _stable octahedral complexes often have 18 valence electrons_ 
	- This is _not true if there are no $\pi$ acceptors_

## Tetrahedral complexes
- Tetrahedral complexes have the point group $T_d$:
![[Td character table.png]]

- The _metal AOs_ are classified according to:
| Cartesian function       | Corresponding orbital(s)      | Irreducible representation     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| $(x^2+y^2+z^2)$          | $4s$                          | Totally symmetric IR, $A_1$ |
| $(x,y,z)$                | $4p_x$,$4p_y$,$4p_z$          | $T_2$                       |
| $(xy,yz,xz)$             | $3d_{xy}$,$3d_{yz}$,$3d_{xz}$ | $T_2$                       |
| $(2z^2-x^2-y^2,x^2-y^2)$ | $3d_{z^2}$,$3d_{x^2-y^2}$     | $E$                               |

- Four $\sigma$ orbitals then transform according to:
$$A_1\oplus T_2$$
- Now, it is the _metal_ $E$ orbitals that are _non-bonding_

- Allowing the relevant orbitals to overlap, and comparing the _metal-based orbitals_ for different complexes:
![[Tetrahedral complex.png]]

- There are _$4$ bonding MOs_, $1a_1$ and $1t_2$

- In this case, the splitting $\Delta_t$ is often _smaller_ than $\Delta_o$ for similar ligands, typically:
$$\Delta_t\approx0.44\Delta_o$$
- In an _octahedral_ complex, the $3d$ orbitals point _directly_ at the ligands
- In a _tetrahedral_ complex, the overlap is _less effective_

- It also means that tetrahedral complexes are typically _high-spin_

## Square planar complexes
- Square planar complexes have the point group $D_{4h}$:
![[D4h character table.png]]

- The _metal AOs_ have symmetries:
| Cartesian function | Corresponding orbital(s) | Irreducible representation     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| $(x^2+y^2+z^2)$    | $4s$                     | Totally symmetric IR, $A_{1g}$ |
| $(x,y)$            | $4p_x$,$4p_y$            | $E_u$                          |
| $(z)$              | $4p_z$                   | $A_{2u}$                       |
| $(xz,yz)$          | $3d_{xz}$,$3d_{yz}$      | $E_g$                          |
| $(xy)$             | $3d_{xy}$                | $B_{2g}$                       |
| $(x^2-y^2)$        | $3d_{x^2-y^2}$           | $B_{1g}$                       |
| $(2z^2-x^2-y^2)$   | $3d_{z^2}$               | $A_{1g}$                               |

- Meanwhile, the four $\sigma$ orbitals transform as:
$$A_{1g}\oplus B_{1g}\oplus E_u$$

- Hence, the overlap creates:
![[Square planar complex.png]]

- Calculations show that the $b_{1g}$ orbitals give _stronger overlap_
- There are _$4$ bonding MOs_, $1a_{1g}$, $1b_{1g}$, and $1e_u$

- The $1e_g$ and $1b_{2g}$ orbitals are _non-bonding_ and _degenerate_
	- If there are $\pi$ interactions, they can _separate_, with $1b_{2g}$ moving _higher_
