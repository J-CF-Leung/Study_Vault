- General discussion and basics of group theory: [[Group Theory]]

- When describing the symmetry of molecules, _only the arrangement of atoms matters_
- The _specific atoms are not important_
- Atoms of the _same element_ are _indistinguishable

# Symmetry elements and operations
- A symmetry _element_: a _type_ of symmetry
- A symmetry _operation_: the _effect of applying_ a symmetry element

- The element is the _generator_ of the operation

## Types of symmetry elements
| Element                            | Operation                  | Symbol   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| Identity                           | Identity                   | $E$      |
| $n-$fold axis of symmetry          | $n-$fold rotation          | $C_n$    |
| Mirror plane                       | Reflection                 | $\sigma$ |
| Centre of symmetry                 | Inversion                  | $i$      |
| $n-$fold axis of improper rotation | $n-$fold improper rotation | $S_n$         |

### Identity $E$
- Literally just do nothing
- Possessed by _all molecules_

### $n-$fold axis of symmetry $C_n$
- The _operation_ is to _rotate the molecule_ by $2\pi/n$ radians

### Mirror planes $\sigma$

### Centre of symmetry $i$

### $n-$fold axis of improper rotation $S_n$
