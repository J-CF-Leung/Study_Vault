- General discussion and basics of group theory: [[Group Theory]]

- When describing the symmetry of molecules, _only the arrangement of atoms matters_
- The _specific atoms are not important_
- Atoms of the _same element_ are _indistinguishable

# Symmetry elements and operations
- A symmetry _element_: a _type_ of symmetry
- A symmetry _operation_: the _effect of applying_ a symmetry element

- The element is the _generator_ of the operation

## Types of symmetry elements
| Element                            | Operation                  | Symbol   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| Identity                           | Identity                   | $E$      |
| $n-$fold axis of symmetry          | $n-$fold rotation          | $C_n$    |
| Mirror plane                       | Reflection                 | $\sigma$ |
| Centre of symmetry                 | Inversion                  | $i$      |
| $n-$fold axis of improper rotation | $n-$fold improper rotation | $S_n$         |

### Identity $E$
- Literally just do nothing
- Possessed by _all molecules_

### $n-$fold axis of symmetry $C_n$
- The _operation_ is to _rotate the molecule_ by $2\pi/n$ radians
	- It is a _proper rotation_, to distinguish it from the improper rotation operation
- Examples - $C_2$ in $H_2O$, $C_3$ in $BF_3$, $C_6$ in benzene

- Succesive rotations _generate different operations_
- A $C_n$ axis will always generate fewer than $n$ operations, as $(C_n)^n\equiv E$, and the axis may be _co-incident with a lower/higher order axis_

- Example: the $C_6$ axis in benzene is also a $C_2$ and a $C_3$ axis

#### Multiple distinct rotational axes and the principal axis
- Molecules can simultaneously possess _multiple axes of symmetry_
- Example: Ethene has _three distinct two-fold axes_, denoted by $C_2^x$, $C_2^y$, $C_2^z$

- Example: Benzene has the $C_6$ axis, along with six other two-fold axes
	- The 3 two-fold axes _bisecting atoms_ are denoted $C_2$
	- The 3 two-fold axes _bisecting bonds_ are denoted $C_2'$

- If the molecule has a _single_ axis of symmetry with a _higher order_, then it is the _principal axis_
- Example: $BF_3$ has 3 $C_2$ axes and one $C_3$ axis, hence the latter is the principal axis
- Example: Water only has one $C_2$ axis, hence it must be the principal axis
- Example: Ethene has no principal axes

### Mirror planes $\sigma$
- The _operation_ is to _reflect_ the molecule in a plane, which is the _mirror plane_
- Example: $H_2O$ has _two_ mirror planes, one _in the plane of the molecule_, and the other _bisecting_ the $H-O-H$ bond angle

- Applying a reflection twice is _equivalent to the identity_, $\sigma^2\equiv E$

- If the mirror plane _contains the principal axis_, it is described as _vertical_, denoted $\sigma_v$
- If the mirror plane is _perpendicular to the principal axis_, it is described as _horizontal_, denoted $\sigma_h$
- If there are multiple mirror planes, they can also be described using _Cartesian coordinates_
	- Example: Ethene has no principal axis, so the planes are $\sigma^{xy},\sigma^{xz},\sigma^{yz}$

#### Sets of mirror planes
- In benzene, the _vertical_ mirror planes are classified into 2 _sets_
- The 3 planes _passing through the atoms_ are denoted $\sigma_v$
- The 3 planes _bisecting the angles between $C_2$ axes_ are named _dihedral_ and denoted $\sigma_d$

### Centre of symmetry $i$
- The operation is to _invert_ the molecule through a _centre of symmetry_
- _Every point_ is moved _through the centre_ in a straight line, then continue _in the same direction for the same distance_, until they reach an _equivalent point_
- Example: Ethene

### $n-$fold axis of improper rotation $S_n$
- The _improper rotation_ involves a _rotation by $2\pi/n$ radians_, followed by _reflection in a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis_
- _Neither_ the rotation or reflection _have to be a symmetry operation by themselves_

- By inspection, one can make the following observations:
	- $S_1$ is _equivalent to reflection_
	- $S_2$ is _equivalent to inversion_
	- For _even $n$_ and _odd $n/2$_, $(S_n)^{n/2}\equiv i$
	- For _odd $n$_, $(S_n)^{2n}\equiv E$
	- For _even_ $n$, $(S_n)^n\equiv E$
- Example: In _ethene_, only _two distinct operations are generated by improper rotation_

### More on proper and improper rotations
- With the proper sequence of _proper and improper rotations_, all _reflections and inversions can also be generated_
- Therefore, _all operations can be taken as a proper or improper rotation_

## Inverses
- For all groups, _each operation $R$ must have an inverse_ $R^{-1}$
- The inverse is defined such that:
$$RR^{-1}\equiv E$$
- For _reflections and inversion_, the _inverse is equal to the operation itself_:
$$\displaylines{(\sigma)^{-1}\equiv\sigma \\ i^{-1}\equiv i}$$

## Classes
- Two symmetry operations, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are said to be in the same _class_ if they were _related by another symmetry operation_ $S$ via:
$$R_2=S^{-1}R_1S$$
- Example: Benzene
	- $C_6$ and $(C_6)^5$ are _related by_ $\sigma_v$ ($C_6^5=\sigma_v^{-1} C_6\sigma_v$) therefore they are _in the same class_

- It can also be thought of as _applying the relating symmetry operation to the symmetry element itself_
- Example: Benzene again
	- The three $\sigma_v$ planes are _related by a $C_6$ operation_, hence they are _in the same class_
	- The three $\sigma_d$ planes are _also related by $C_6$_
	- However, they are in _separate classes_

# Point groups
- The _point group_ of a molecule is determined by _the set of symmetry elements it possesses_

## Names
- If a molecule is _linear_, then the group contains the $\infty$ subscript
- If it has a _mirror plane perpendicular to axis_, it is $D_{\infty h}$, otherwise it is $C_{\infty v}$

- If a $C_n$ principal axis also has $n$ $C_2$ axes _perpendicular_ to it, then it is denoted $D$
- Otherwise, it is simply labelled $C$

- If there is a _horizontal plane_ present, it is labelled with subscript $h$
- _Otherwise_, if it is a $C$ group, the subscript is $v$, or $d$ if it is a $D$ group

- If there is an $S_{2n}$ axis _collinear_ with the $C_n$ axis, then the group is $S_{2n}$

- Special groups:
	- Tetrahedral - $T$
	- Octahedral - $O$
	- Icosahedral - $I$

## Character Tables
- _Character tables_ list all of the symmetry elements in a group
- The elements are _grouped into classes_
- It also lists all of the _irreducible representations_ (see below) for the group, as well as the _Cartesian functions_ that transform as the representation

- Example: $C_{2v}$

- Example: $D_{3h}$

# Representations
- The point group of a molecule takes the _atoms_ into consideration
- However, the _symmetry operations can change the orientations of electron orbitals_
	- They can remain unchanged, i.e. they are _symmetric_ w.r.t. the operation
	- They can be reversed, i.e. _antisymmetric_ w.r.t. the operation
	- Or they can be moved. _transforming_ into orbitals on other atoms

- The _ways in which orbitals_ (characterised by functions) _transform_ are listed as _representations_ of a group
- A representation is denoted $\Gamma$

- Example for finding a representation: _atomic orbitals_ of _oxygen in water_
	- Group, $C_{2v}$, with operations $E$, $C_2^z$, $\sigma^{xz}$, $\sigma^{yz}$
	- $2s$ is _totally symmetric_ with respect to these operations, transforming like $A_1$
	- Following this, $p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$ transform like $B_1$, $B_2$, and $A_1$ respectively

- If an orbital _transforms as a Cartesian function_ (e.g. $x$, $y^2$, $xz$), then its representation _can be read from the character table_
	- A factor of $\exp(-r)$ is _directionless_ and _can be ignored_ when finding representation
	- Needs to have the _origin on the "central" atom_
	- Example: $p_x$ on the oxygen atom of water transforms as $x$, and therefore is represented by $B_1$
	- For _multi-dimensional_ representations (see below), it transforms as a _set_ of functions

## Representation matrices and characters
- On most molecules, orbitals _not on the central atom_ will be _moved_ by some of the symmetry operations
- In this case, using _multiple orbitals as a basis_, one can represent the action of the operation via a _representation matrix_
	- The _dimension_ of the representation is equal to _the number of basis orbitals_

- Example: The _hydrogen orbitals in water_, $s_A$ and $s_B$:
	- The action of $C_2^z$ - 
	$$\displaylines{C_2^zs_A=s_B \hspace{1cm} C_2^zs_B=s_A \\ \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}s_A \\ s_B\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}s_B \\ s_A\end{pmatrix}}$$
	- The matrix on the LHS is the _representation matrix_ for $C_2^z$

- The _trace_ of a representation matrix is known as the _character_ of the operation
	- The _character of the identity_ operation is equal to the _dimension_ of the representation

- If there is an operation $R$, then the character is _denoted_ $\chi(R)$

- The characters can be found _without writing out the representation matrix_:
	- _Add_ $1$ for _each orbital symmetric w.r.t. the operation_
	- _Subtract_ $1$ for each orbital _antisymmetric_ w.r.t. the operation
	- Add $0$ for each orbital _moved_ by the operation

## Reducible representations
- A _multi-dimensional_ representation may simply be a _direct sum_
- In this case, the representation is said to be _reducible_
- If not, they are termed _irreducible_
	- All _one-dimensional_ representations are irreducible
	- _Multi-dimensional_ ones can also be irreducible

- A _one-dimensional_ irreducible representation can be said to _transform like a single Cartesian function_
- As for a _multi-dimensional_ irreducible representation, it _transforms like a set of functions_
	- Example: $E'$ in the $D_{3h}$ group transforms like functions $(x,y)$
	- In this case, one needs a _basis set of orbitals_ transforming like these functions

- Example: Two hydrogen orbitals in water $(C_{2v})$
	- The characters are $(2,0,2,0)$
	- Inspecting the chracter table, this is equivalent to $A_1\oplus B_1$

- Example: Three $2s$ Fluorine orbitals in $\text{BF}_3$
	- The characters are $(3,0,1,3,0,1)$
	- This is equivalent to $A_1'\oplus E'$
	- A one-dimensional, plus a two-dimensional irreducible representation

### Reduction formula
- Let the $k-$th _irreducible representation_ be $\Gamma^{(k)}$
- Then, the reducible representation can be represented as:
$$\Gamma=\sum_k a_k\Gamma^{(k)}$$
- The coefficients $a_k$ can be found by the _reduction formula_:
$$a_k=\frac{1}{n_R(\Gamma^{(k)})}\sum_R\left[\chi^{(k)}(R)\right]^*\chi(R)$$
- $n_R$ is the _total number of operations_ in the group
- $\chi^{(k)}$ is the character _of the irreducible representation_
- $\chi$ is the character _of the reducible representation_

## Nomenclature of irreducible representations
- _Dimension_ (character of _identity_ operation) determines _letter_
	- 1-dimensional: $A$, $B$
	- 2-dimensional: $E$
	- 3-dimensional: $T$

- _Rotation about principal axis_ further determines the _letter_ for _1-dimensional_ IRs
	- _Symmetric_: $A$
	- _Anti-symmetric_: $B$

- _Inversion_ about centre of symmetry determines a _subscript_
	- _Even_: $g$
	- _Odd_: $u$

- _Reflection_ across the $\sigma_h$ plane (perpendicular to principal axis):
	- Symmetric: _prime_ $(\text{'})$
	- Anti-symmetric: _double-prime_ $(\text{''})$
