- General discussion and basics of group theory: [[Group Theory]]

- When describing the symmetry of molecules, _only the arrangement of atoms matters_
- The _specific atoms are not important_
- Atoms of the _same element_ are _indistinguishable

# Symmetry elements and operations
- A symmetry _element_: a _type_ of symmetry
- A symmetry _operation_: the _effect of applying_ a symmetry element

- The element is the _generator_ of the operation

## Types of symmetry elements
| Element                            | Operation                  | Symbol   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| Identity                           | Identity                   | $E$      |
| $n-$fold axis of symmetry          | $n-$fold rotation          | $C_n$    |
| Mirror plane                       | Reflection                 | $\sigma$ |
| Centre of symmetry                 | Inversion                  | $i$      |
| $n-$fold axis of improper rotation | $n-$fold improper rotation | $S_n$         |

### Identity $E$
- Literally just do nothing
- Possessed by _all molecules_

### $n-$fold axis of symmetry $C_n$
- The _operation_ is to _rotate the molecule_ by $2\pi/n$ radians
	- It is a _proper rotation_, to distinguish it from the improper rotation operation
- Examples - $C_2$ in $H_2O$, $C_3$ in $BF_3$, $C_6$ in benzene

- Succesive rotations _generate different operations_
- A $C_n$ axis will always generate fewer than $n$ operations, as $(C_n)^n\equiv E$, and the axis may be _co-incident with a lower/higher order axis_

- Example: the $C_6$ axis in benzene is also a $C_2$ and a $C_3$ axis

#### Multiple distinct rotational axes and the principal axis
- Molecules can simultaneously possess _multiple axes of symmetry_
- Example: Ethene has _three distinct two-fold axes_, denoted by $C_2^x$, $C_2^y$, $C_2^z$

- Example: Benzene has the $C_6$ axis, along with six other two-fold axes
	- The 3 two-fold axes _bisecting atoms_ are denoted $C_2$
	- The 3 two-fold axes _bisecting bonds_ are denoted $C_2'$

- If the molecule has a _single_ axis of symmetry with a _higher order_, then it is the _principal axis_
- Example: $BF_3$ has 3 $C_2$ axes and one $C_3$ axis, hence the latter is the principal axis
- Example: Water only has one $C_2$ axis, hence it must be the principal axis
- Example: Ethene has no principal axes

### Mirror planes $\sigma$
- The _operation_ is to _reflect_ the molecule in a plane, which is the _mirror plane_
- Example: $H_2O$ has _two_ mirror planes, one _in the plane of the molecule_, and the other _bisecting_ the $H-O-H$ bond angle

- Applying a reflection twice is _equivalent to the identity_, $\sigma^2\equiv E$

- If the mirror plane _contains the principal axis_, it is described as _vertical_, denoted $\sigma_v$
- If the mirror plane is _perpendicular to the principal axis_, it is described as _horizontal_, denoted $\sigma_h$
- If there are multiple mirror planes, they can also be described using _Cartesian coordinates_
	- Example: Ethene has no principal axis, so the planes are $\sigma^{xy},\sigma^{xz},\sigma^{yz}$

#### Sets of mirror planes
- In benzene, the _vertical_ mirror planes are classified into 2 _sets_
- The 3 planes _passing through the atoms_ are denoted $\sigma_v$
- The 3 planes _bisecting the angles between $C_2$ axes_ are named _dihedral_ and denoted $\sigma_d$

### Centre of symmetry $i$
- The operation is to _invert_ the molecule through a _centre of symmetry_
- _Every point_ is moved _through the centre_ in a straight line, then continue _in the same direction for the same distance_, until they reach an _equivalent point_
- Example: Ethene

### $n-$fold axis of improper rotation $S_n$
- The _improper rotation_ involves a _rotation by $2\pi/n$ radians_, followed by _reflection in a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis_
- _Neither_ the rotation or reflection _have to be a symmetry operation by themselves_
