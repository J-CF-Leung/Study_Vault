- General discussion and basics of group theory: [[Group Theory]]

- When describing the symmetry of molecules, _only the arrangement of atoms matters_
- The _specific atoms are not important_
- Atoms of the _same element_ are _indistinguishable

# Symmetry elements and operations
- A symmetry _element_: a _type_ of symmetry
- A symmetry _operation_: the _effect of applying_ a symmetry element

- The element is the _generator_ of the operation

## Types of symmetry elements
| Element                            | Operation                  | Symbol   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| Identity                           | Identity                   | $E$      |
| $n-$fold axis of symmetry          | $n-$fold rotation          | $C_n$    |
| Mirror plane                       | Reflection                 | $\sigma$ |
| Centre of symmetry                 | Inversion                  | $i$      |
| $n-$fold axis of improper rotation | $n-$fold improper rotation | $S_n$         |

### Identity $E$
- Literally just do nothing
- Possessed by _all molecules_

### $n-$fold axis of symmetry $C_n$
- The _operation_ is to _rotate the molecule_ by $2\pi/n$ radians
	- It is a _proper rotation_, to distinguish it from the improper rotation operation
- Examples - $C_2$ in $H_2O$, $C_3$ in $BF_3$, $C_6$ in benzene
![[Rotation axes.jpg|650]]

- Succesive rotations _generate different operations_
- A $C_n$ axis will always generate fewer than $n$ operations, as $(C_n)^n\equiv E$, and the axis may be _co-incident with a lower/higher order axis_
![[Benzene C6.jpg]]

- Example: the $C_6$ axis in benzene is also a $C_2$ and a $C_3$ axis

#### Multiple distinct rotational axes and the principal axis
- Molecules can simultaneously possess _multiple axes of symmetry_
- Example: Ethene has _three distinct two-fold axes_, denoted by $C_2^x$, $C_2^y$, $C_2^z$
![[Ethene C2.jpg|300]]

- Example: Benzene has the $C_6$ axis, along with six other two-fold axes
	- The 3 two-fold axes _bisecting atoms_ are denoted $C_2$
	- The 3 two-fold axes _bisecting bonds_ are denoted $C_2'$
![[Benzene C2.png]]

- If the molecule has a _single_ axis of symmetry with a _higher order_, then it is the _principal axis_
- Example: $BF_3$ has 3 $C_2$ axes and one $C_3$ axis, hence the latter is the principal axis
- Example: Water only has one $C_2$ axis, hence it must be the principal axis
- Example: Ethene has no principal axes
![[Principal axes.jpg]]

### Mirror planes $\sigma$
- The _operation_ is to _reflect_ the molecule in a plane, which is the _mirror plane_
- Example: $H_2O$ has _two_ mirror planes, one _in the plane of the molecule_, and the other _bisecting_ the $H-O-H$ bond angle
![[Water mirror planes.png|250]]

- Applying a reflection twice is _equivalent to the identity_, $\sigma^2\equiv E$

- If the mirror plane _contains the principal axis_, it is described as _vertical_, denoted $\sigma_v$
- If the mirror plane is _perpendicular to the principal axis_, it is described as _horizontal_, denoted $\sigma_h$
![[BF3 mirror planes.jpg]]

- If there are multiple mirror planes, they can also be described using _Cartesian coordinates_
	- Example: Ethene has no principal axis, so the planes are $\sigma^{xy},\sigma^{xz},\sigma^{yz}$

#### Sets of mirror planes
- In benzene, the _vertical_ mirror planes are classified into 2 _sets_
- The 3 planes _passing through the atoms_ are denoted $\sigma_v$
- The 3 planes _bisecting the angles between $C_2$ axes_ are named _dihedral_ and denoted $\sigma_d$
![[Benzene mirror planes.jpg]]

### Centre of symmetry $i$
- The operation is to _invert_ the molecule through a _centre of symmetry_
- _Every point_ is moved _through the centre_ in a straight line, then continue _in the same direction for the same distance_, until they reach an _equivalent point_
- Example: Ethene
![[Ethene inversion.jpg]]

### $n-$fold axis of improper rotation $S_n$
- The _improper rotation_ involves a _rotation by $2\pi/n$ radians_, followed by _reflection in a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis_
- _Neither_ the rotation or reflection _have to be a symmetry operation by themselves_
![[BF3 S3.jpg|600]]

- By inspection, one can make the following observations:
	- $S_1$ is _equivalent to reflection_
	- $S_2$ is _equivalent to inversion_
	- For _even $n$_ and _odd $n/2$_, $(S_n)^{n/2}\equiv i$
	- For _odd $n$_, $(S_n)^{2n}\equiv E$
	- For _even_ $n$, $(S_n)^n\equiv E$
- Example: In _ethane_, only _two distinct operations are generated by improper rotation_
![[Ethane S6.jpg|450]]

### More on proper and improper rotations
- With the proper sequence of _proper and improper rotations_, all _reflections and inversions can also be generated_
- Therefore, _all operations can be taken as a proper or improper rotation_

## Inverses
- For all groups, _each operation $R$ must have an inverse_ $R^{-1}$
- The inverse is defined such that:
$$RR^{-1}\equiv E$$
- For _reflections and inversion_, the _inverse is equal to the operation itself_:
$$\displaylines{(\sigma)^{-1}\equiv\sigma \\ i^{-1}\equiv i}$$
![[Reflection inverse.jpg]]

## Classes
- Two symmetry operations, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are said to be in the same _class_ if they were _related by another symmetry operation_ $S$ via:
$$R_2=S^{-1}R_1S$$
- Example: Benzene
	- $C_6$ and $(C_6)^5$ are _related by_ $\sigma_v$ ($C_6^5=\sigma_v^{-1} C_6\sigma_v$) therefore they are _in the same class_
![[Benzene C6 class.jpg]]
- It can also be thought of as _applying the relating symmetry operation to the symmetry element itself_
- Example: Benzene again
	- The three $\sigma_v$ planes are _related by a $C_6$ operation_, hence they are _in the same class_
	- The three $\sigma_d$ planes are _also related by $C_6$_
	- However, they are in _separate classes_
![[Benzene C6 classes.jpg]]
# Point groups
- The _point group_ of a molecule is determined by _the set of symmetry elements it possesses_

## Names
- If a molecule is _linear_, then the group contains the $\infty$ subscript
- If it has a _mirror plane perpendicular to axis_, it is $D_{\infty h}$, otherwise it is $C_{\infty v}$

- If a $C_n$ principal axis also has $n$ $C_2$ axes _perpendicular_ to it, then it is denoted $D$
- Otherwise, it is simply labelled $C$

- If there is a _horizontal plane_ present, it is labelled with subscript $h$
- _Otherwise_, if it is a $C$ group, the subscript is $v$, or $d$ if it is a $D$ group

- If there is an $S_{2n}$ axis _collinear_ with the $C_n$ axis, then the group is $S_{2n}$

- Special groups:
	- Tetrahedral - $T$
	- Octahedral - $O$
	- Icosahedral - $I$

![[Point groups flow chart.png]]

## Character Tables
- _Character tables_ list all of the symmetry elements in a group
- The elements are _grouped into classes_
- It also lists all of the _irreducible representations_ (see below) for the group, as well as the _Cartesian functions_ that transform as the representation

- Example: $C_{2v}$
![[C2v table.png]]

- Example: $D_{3h}$
![[Chemistry/Images/D3h character table.png]]

- Example: _Octahedral_ group $O_h$
![[Oh character table.png]]

# Representations
- The point group of a molecule takes the _atoms_ into consideration
- However, the _symmetry operations can change the orientations of electron orbitals_
	- They can remain unchanged, i.e. they are _symmetric_ w.r.t. the operation
	- They can be reversed, i.e. _antisymmetric_ w.r.t. the operation
	- Or they can be moved. _transforming_ into orbitals on other atoms

- The _ways in which orbitals_ (characterised by functions) _transform_ are listed as _representations_ of a group
- A representation is denoted $\Gamma$

- Example for finding a representation: _atomic orbitals_ of _oxygen in water_
	- Group, $C_{2v}$, with operations $E$, $C_2^z$, $\sigma^{xz}$, $\sigma^{yz}$
	- $2s$ is _totally symmetric_ with respect to these operations, transforming like $A_1$
	- Following this, $p_x$, $p_y$, $p_z$ transform like $B_1$, $B_2$, and $A_1$ respectively
![[Water O representations.jpg]]

- If an orbital _transforms as a Cartesian function_ (e.g. $x$, $y^2$, $xz$), then its representation _can be read from the character table_
	- A factor of $\exp(-r)$ is _directionless_ and _can be ignored_ when finding representation
	- Needs to have the _origin on the "central" atom_
	- Example: $p_x$ on the oxygen atom of water transforms as $x$, and therefore is represented by $B_1$
	- For _multi-dimensional_ representations (see below), it transforms as a _set_ of functions

- For all groups, there is a _totally symmetric irreducible representation_, for which _all of the characters are $+1$_, it is denoted $\Gamma^\text{tot. sym}$

## Representation matrices and characters
- On most molecules, orbitals _not on the central atom_ will be _moved_ by some of the symmetry operations
- In this case, using _multiple orbitals as a basis_, one can represent the action of the operation via a _representation matrix_
	- The _dimension_ of the representation is equal to _the number of basis orbitals_

- Example: The _hydrogen orbitals in water_, $s_A$ and $s_B$:
	- The action of $C_2^z$ - 
	$$\displaylines{C_2^zs_A=s_B \hspace{1cm} C_2^zs_B=s_A \\ \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}s_A \\ s_B\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}s_B \\ s_A\end{pmatrix}}$$
	- The matrix on the LHS is the _representation matrix_ for $C_2^z$

- The _trace_ of a representation matrix is known as the _character_ of the operation
	- The _character of the identity_ operation is equal to the _dimension_ of the representation

- If there is an operation $R$, then the character is _denoted_ $\chi(R)$

- The characters can be found _without writing out the representation matrix_:
	- _Add_ $1$ for _each orbital symmetric w.r.t. the operation_
	- _Subtract_ $1$ for each orbital _antisymmetric_ w.r.t. the operation
	- Add $0$ for each orbital _moved_ by the operation

## Reducible representations
- A _multi-dimensional_ representation may simply be a _direct sum_
- In this case, the representation is said to be _reducible_
- If not, they are termed _irreducible_
	- All _one-dimensional_ representations are irreducible
	- _Multi-dimensional_ ones can also be irreducible

- A _one-dimensional_ irreducible representation can be said to _transform like a single Cartesian function_
- As for a _multi-dimensional_ irreducible representation, it _transforms like a set of functions_
	- Example: $E'$ in the $D_{3h}$ group transforms like functions $(x,y)$
	- In this case, one needs a _basis set of orbitals_ transforming like these functions

- Example: Two hydrogen orbitals in water $(C_{2v})$
	- The characters are $(2,0,2,0)$
	- Inspecting the chracter table, this is equivalent to $A_1\oplus B_1$

- Example: Three $2s$ Fluorine orbitals in $\text{BF}_3$
	- The characters are $(3,0,1,3,0,1)$
	- This is equivalent to $A_1'\oplus E'$
	- A one-dimensional, plus a two-dimensional irreducible representation

### Reduction formula
- Let the $k-$th _irreducible representation_ be $\Gamma^{(k)}$
- Then, the reducible representation can be represented as:
$$\Gamma=\sum_k a_k\Gamma^{(k)}$$
- The coefficients $a_k$ can be found by the _reduction formula_:
$$a_k=\frac{1}{n_R(\Gamma^{(k)})}\sum_R\left[\chi^{(k)}(R)\right]^*\chi(R)$$
- $n_R$ is the _total number of operations_ in the group
- $\chi^{(k)}$ is the character _of the irreducible representation_
- $\chi$ is the character _of the reducible representation_

## Nomenclature of irreducible representations
- _Dimension_ (character of _identity_ operation) determines _letter_
	- 1-dimensional: $A$, $B$
	- 2-dimensional: $E$
	- 3-dimensional: $T$

- _Rotation about principal axis_ further determines the _letter_ for _1-dimensional_ IRs
	- _Symmetric_: $A$
	- _Anti-symmetric_: $B$

- _Inversion_ about centre of symmetry determines a _subscript_
	- _Even_: $g$
	- _Odd_: $u$

- _Reflection_ across the $\sigma_h$ plane (perpendicular to principal axis):
	- Symmetric: _prime_ $(\text{'})$
	- Anti-symmetric: _double-prime_ $(\text{''})$

# Infinite groups
- For _linear molecules_, there is an _infinite number of symmetry operations_
- The _principal axis_ is the _internuclear axis_, and rotation about it by _any angle_ $\alpha$ is a symmetry operation

## Non-centrosymmetric molecules

- If a molecule is _not centrosymmetric_ (e.g. $\text{OCS}$), then it belongs to the point group $C_{\infty v}$:
![[C inf v character table.png]]
- Taking the _internuclear axis_ as the $z-$ axis, there is an _infinite number_ of rotation operations generated, denoted $C^z(\alpha)$
- There is also an _inifnite number of mirror planes_, $\infty\sigma_v$, which _contain the internuclear axis_
- The _totally symmetric_ IR is labelled $\Sigma^+$

## Centrosymmetric molecules

- If a molecule is _centrosymmetric_ (e.g. $\text{CO}_2$), then it belongs to the point group $D_{\infty h}$
![[D inf v character table.png]]
- In addition to the _principal axis_, there is also an _inifinite number of $C_2$ axes_
- The _principal axis_ also becomes an _axis of improper rotation_, around any angle
- There is also a _centre of inversion_
- There is a $\sigma_h$ plane, however that _corresponds to_ $S^z(\alpha)$

## The irreducible representations
- If a group is _one-dimensional_, it is labelled $\Sigma$
	- The $\pm$ indicates whether or not it is _symmetric or antisymmetric under $\sigma_v$ reflection_

- For $D_{\infty h}$, the $g/u$ subscript indicates symmetry _under inversion_
	- $g$: symmetric (gerunde)
	- $u$: antisymmetric

- A state _transforming as_ a $\Sigma$ IR has _zero angular momentum_
- $\Pi$, $\Delta$, $\Phi$ IRs are all _two-dimensional_, and correspond to $\pm1$, $\pm2$, and $\pm3$ _units of angular momentum about the principal axis_

# Application to molecular properties
- Many _physical properties_ are reliant on the symmetry of the molecule
- As these properties are _intrinsic_, they must _not be affected by symmetry operations_

- Some properties (such as dipole moment) can change if the molecule is _distorted_
- Typically, the properties under discussion assume its _equilibrium geometry_

## Dipole moments
- The _dipole moment_ of a molecule must be _linear_ in terms of coordinates:
$$\bm{p}=\sum_i q_i\bm{r}_i$$
- Hence, it must transform as some _linear combination_ of $x$, $y$, and $z$
- The dipole moment _cannot be affected by symmetry operations_
- Hence, a molecule _only possesses a permanent dipole moment iff_ $x,y$ or $z$ _transform as the totally symmetric IR_

- If a molecule has a _centre of symmetry_, then since linear combinations of the coordinates are _anti-symmetric_, then it _cannot possess a permanent dipole moment_

## Chirality
- Chiral molecules _cannot be super-imposed on their mirror image_
- This is true iff the molecule _does not possess any improper axes of rotation_ $S_n$

- A _mirror plane_ is equivalent to $S_1$
- A _centre of symmetry_ is equivalent to $S_2$
- A molecule having _either_ is therefore _achiral_

- One way of generating chirality is having a _chiral centre_
- Example: carbon atom in _amino acids_
![[Amino acid.png]]

- Or, chirality can be generated by _restricting rotation_, or _fused rings_:
![[Chiral molecules.png]]

# Direct products
- Given which representations two functions may transform as, one may want to know how the _product_ of those functions transform

- Mathematically, the representation is given by the [[Group Theory|direct product]]
- The _characters_ multiply directly, operation by operation

- Example: $B_1\otimes B_2$ for $C_{2v}$ gives $A_2$

- The direct product is _commutative and associative_
- _Any number_ of direct products can be done successively and in any order

- _Scalars_ will _only transform as the totally symmetric IR_ $\Gamma^\text{tot. sym}$, _except for zero_
	- Zero _can also transform as any other representation_

## 1D Irreducible representations
- For 1D IRs, the characters _must be $\pm1$_
- Hence, a direct product between 2 1D IRs will _always give a 1D IR_

- Since all characters of the _totally symmetric IR_ $\Gamma^\text{tot. sym}$ are $+1$, _multiplying an IR with it leaves it unchanged_:
$$\Gamma^{(i)}\otimes\Gamma^\text{tot. sym}=\Gamma^{(i)}$$
- From similar logic, _multiplying a 1D IR with itself gives the totally symmetric IR_:
$$\Gamma^{(i)}\otimes \Gamma^{(i)}=\Gamma^\text{tot. sym}$$

## Higher dimensional irreducible representations
- Higher dimensional IRs have _character under the identity_ $>1$
- The first property from above _still holds_:
$$\Gamma^{(i)}\otimes\Gamma^\text{tot. sym}=\Gamma^{(i)}$$

- However, _multiplying an IR with itself_ will give a _reducible representation_, which will _always contain the totally symmetric IR_
- Example: $E\otimes E$ for $C_{3v}$:
$$E\otimes E=E+A_1+A_2$$

# Vanishing integrals
- Consider the integral of a particular function $\psi$ (_not necessarily a wave function_):
$$\int_\text{all space} \psi\,d\tau$$
- If the function was _odd_ in whatever way, it would be _zero_
- However, _even functions_ can also give _zero_

- If the integral gives a _non-zero scalar_, this means it _transforms as ONLY the totally symmetric IR_

- Hence, if the _representation_ of $\psi$ _does NOT contain the totally symmetric IR_, then _it must integrate to zero_

## Overlap integrals
- When doing [[Molecular quantum mechanics#Linear combination of atomic orbitals|LCAO calculations]], one often encounters the _overlap integral_:
$$S_{ij}=\int \psi_i^*\psi_j\,d\tau$$
- The _integrand_ transforms as $\Gamma^{(i)}\otimes \Gamma^{(j)}$

- From the properties established above:
- The _overlap integral_ $S_{ij}$ is _only non-zero iff_ $\psi_i$ and $\psi_j$ _transform as the same irreducible IRs_
- Put more simply, _only wave functions with the same symmetry have non-zero overlap_

## Matrix elements
- Consider the matrix element of an operator $\hat{Q}$ w.r.t. wave functions $\psi_i$ and $\psi_j$:
$$Q_{ij}=\int \psi_i^*\hat{Q}\psi_j\,d\tau$$
- The integrand transforms as a _triple direct product_, with the IRs of the _operator_ and the _two wave functions_

### Hamiltonian
- In the LCAO method, when calculating the _energy of an MO_ formed from AOs $s_A$ and $s_B$, one needs _two parameters_:
$$\displaylines{\alpha=\int s_A\hat{\Ham}s_A\,d\tau=\int s_B\hat{\Ham}s_B\,d\tau \\ \beta=\int s_A\hat{\Ham}s_B\,d\tau}$$
- [[Bonding in molecules]]
- As $\alpha$ is simply the _energy of the orbitals themselves_, bonding can only occur if $\beta\neq0$

- The Hamiltonian represents _energy_, which _cannot be changed by symmetry operations_
- Hence, $\hat{\Ham}$ is represented by the _totally symmetric IR_

- Therefore, _orbitals can only form MOs when they transform as the same IR_

### IR spectroscopy
- In IR spectroscopy, a transition between states $\psi_i$ and $\psi_j$ only occur if:
$$\braket{\psi_i|\hat{\mu}|\psi_j}\neq0$$
- This is [[Molecular quantum mechanics#Spectroscopic principles|Fermi's Golden Rule]]
- If a molecule has a [[#Dipole moments|permanent dipole moment]], then $\hat{\mu}$ transforms as the _totally symmetric irreducible representation_
- Therefore, the transition only occurs if $\psi_i$ and $\psi_j$ transform as the _same IR_
- This takes the vibrational wave function into account
- [[Molecular spectroscopy#Symmetry-allowed transitions]]
