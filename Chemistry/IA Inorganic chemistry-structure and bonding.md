# Main group covalent bonds and structures
- Features of bonding and structure are inextricably linked to [[IA Inorganic chemistry-periodicity and the elements|periodic properties]]
## Homonuclear bond strengths
- More electronegative elements form stronger homonuclear bonds with lower energy orbitals
- Down a group: orbitals get more diffuse, bond strength decreases
- Across a period: increase in single and multiple bond energies as $Z_{eff}$ increases
	- Group 15-17: $\ce{N-N, O-O, F-F}$ single bonds are unusually weak
	- Shorter bonds result in increased electron-electron repulsion
	- $\pi$-bonding becomes preferred for period 2, but becomes weaker for other periods as $\sigma$ bonds become stronger
## Structure of p-block elements
### Group 14
- Carbon forms graphite, containing layers of hexagonal sheets with conjugation of p-orbitals giving rise to semiconductivity
	- Graphite has staggered (AB) structure
	- Weak van der Waals interactions lets sheets slip over each other
- Carbon also forms a $\sigma$-bonded diamond structure
- Group 14 elements in later periods initially adopt a diamond structure before distorting to a metal close-packed arrangement
### Group 15
- Nitrogen prefers triple bonds due to weak $\sigma$-bonding
- Phosphorus narrowly favours single bonds
	- White phosphorus: $\ce{P_4}$, polymerises into red phosphors
	- Black phosphorus is composed of hexagonal sheets, a structure adopted by other group 15 elements
### Group 16
- Oxygen prefers double bonds
- Sulfur has many allotropes, but the most stable form is a polymeric helical structure also adopted by other group 16 elements
### Group 17
- All elements in group 17 form $\ce{X_2}$ molecules
- $\ce{F2}$ and $\ce{Cl2}$ are gases due to compact orbitals leading to weak van der Waals forces, with $\ce{Br2}$ being a liquid and $\ce{I2}$ being a solid
![[p-block structures.png|300]]
	- Down the group, 1 bond between the "units" becomes lone pairs
	- Giant continuous structure->sheets->helices->individual molecules

## d-block homoatomic bonds
- Homoatomic bonds between d-block elements get stronger down a group
- In period 3, the d-orbital is more core-like, while 4d and 5d are more valence-like
- Bond energies depend on a balance between availability of the d-orbital and number of electrons
	- Maximised at group 6 ($\ce{Cr, Mo, W}$)
## Heteroatomic bonds
- Comparison: p-block elements bonded to specific atom
- Specifics of bond energy depend on 2 main factors:
	- Differences in electronegativity (Strength of ionic contribution)
	- Match in orbital size and energy
- s-block:
	- Form very ionic/electrostatic bonds, little covalent contribution
	- On average, group 2 forms stronger ionic bonds due to higher charge
- p-block:
	- Down a group, bond strength increases from n=2 to n=3 before decreasing
		- Covalent contribution decreases as orbitals are less well-matched
		- Ionic contribution increases and initially overcomes decrease
		- For elements in lower periods, "flattening" effect is seen down the group
	- Group 13: steady decrease as $\ce{B-F}$ bonds include $\pi$ bonding contribution
	- Across period 2, bond strength usually decreases due to lone pair repulsion
	- Tendency for $\pi$ bonding decreases down the group as p-orbital overlap becomes less efficient
	- Single bonds tend to dominate for $n\geq3$  
- Polar bonds
	- Polar: tends to be stronger than a purely covalent bond
	- Stevenson-Schomaker equation:
	$$r_{AB}=r_A+r_B-9\Delta\chi$$
		- All radii are in picometers (pm)

## Structures: the isoelectronic principle
- Species that are (valence) isoelectronic are isostructural
- Examples:
	- $\ce{KSi}$, effectively $\ce{K+Si-}$, $\ce{Si-}$: $s^2p^3$, forms black phosphorus structure (sheets)
	- $\ce{CaSi}$, $\ce{Si^{2-}}$: $s^2p^4$, forms sulphur helix structure
- $\ce{B-N}$ compounds: isoelectronic with $\ce{C-C}$ compounds
	- Average covalent radius and electronegativity similar to $\ce{C}$
	- Capable of same range of hybridisation
	- Example: hexagonal boron nitride ($\ce{B-N}$)
		- Layers are eclipsed, with stronger interactions between them due to polarised $\ce{B-N}$ bonds, making the material brittle
		- Weaker $\pi-$bonding due to orbital size mismatch
		- Becomes diamond form at high temperature
	- Many $\ce{B-N}$ analogues of carbon compounds exist (e.g. $\ce{B3N3H6}$, borazine)

## Molecular shapes: VSEPR
- Structures follow 4 rules:
	1. The most favourable arrangement for a given number of electron pairs is the one which minimises repulsion (lowest electrostatic energy)
	2. Non-bonding electron pairs repel more than bonding ones
	3. The bonding pair is distributed towards the most electronegative atom
	4. Double bonds and triple bonds repel more than single bonds
- Sometimes, 2 arrangements can have very similar energy
- Arrangements following rule 1
Number of electron pairs | Common arrangement (Example) | Alternative (Example)
------- | --------------- | -----------------
2 | Linear ($\ce{BeCl2}$) | 
3 | Trigonal planar ($\ce{BF3}$) | 
4 | Tetrahedral ($\ce{CH4}$) | 
5 | Trigonal bipyramid ($\ce{PF5}$) | Square-based pyramid <br> ($\ce{SbPh5}$)
6 | Octahedral ($\ce{SF6}$) | 
7 | Pentagonal bipyramid ($\ce{IF7}$) | Mono-capped octahedron <br> ($\ce{MoF7-}$)
8 | Square antiprism ($\ce{IF8-}$) |
- When there is an alternative arrangement, only an average is typically detected at room temperature
- Rule 2: lp/lp > lp/bp > bp/bp
	- Large repulsion between lone pairs --> smaller angle between bond pairs
	- For molecules with 2 lp and 3 bp, preferred arrangement is "T-shape"
	- For molecules involving high $n$ orbitals, some pairs may be stereochemically inert and does not influence shape (e.g. $\ce{TeF6^{2-}}$ is distorted octahedral)
- Rule 3: Position of bonding pair within the bond changes bond angle
	- Bond pair further away from central atom --> smaller angle produces same repulsion
	- Axial position occupied by most electronegative atom
- Rule 4: single/double > single/single

- Fluxionality: shapes are not necessarily fixed
	- Berry pseudo-rotation of $\ce{BF5}$:
		- Trigonal bipyramid $\ce{<-->}$ Square-based pyramid $\ce{<-->}$ Trigonal bipyramid
		- Most stable: trigonal bipyramid, small energy barrier for square-based
		- Two trigonal states have different fluorines at axial positions 
		- Room temp. NMR spectrum: 1 doublet due to $\ce{P-F}$ coupling
		- Low temp. spectrum: doublet of triplets (equatorial) + doublet of quartets (axial)
- Limit of valence bond/VSEPR approach: only handles 2-centre, 2-electron bonds
	- Counter-example: $\ce{B2H6}$
- Hypervalency: violation of octet rule, electrons not accomodated by s and p orbitals
	- d-orbitals are too high in energy for p-block elements to use in bonding
	- Axial bonds can be thought of as electron-deficient 3c-4e bonds

## Ionic lattices
- Composed of elements from opposite ends of periodic table
- Bonding involves little covalency, and is non-directional
- Overview of common $\ce{AB}$ structures:
	- Detailed description: [[Crystal structure and diffraction]]
	- Four-coordinate:
		- Zinc blende (cubic $\ce{ZnS}$), cubic F with half of tetrahedral interstices filled
		- Wurtzite (hexagonal $\ce{ZnS}$)
	- Six-coordinate:
		- Table salt ($\ce{NaCl}$), cubic F with all octahedral interstices filled
	- Eight-coordinate:
		- Caesium chloride ($\ce{CsCl}$), primitive cubic with cubic interstices filled
- Predicting lattices:
	- Ion in interstice must prevent coordinated ions from touching each other
	- Coordination number increases with $r_A/r_B$ ratio
	- Differences between observed and predicted structures: covalency and directionality
- Lattice energy calculation
	- Born-Land√© equation:
	$$E_{lattice}=-\frac{MN_Ae^2Z^+Z^-}{4\pi\epsilon_0(r_++r_-)}(1-\frac{1}{n})$$
		- $M$: Madelung constant, depends on structure of lattice
		- $n$: Born exponent, takes repulsion into account
		- Assumptions: hard spheres, no covalency (high $\Delta \chi$)
	- Kapustinskii equation:
	$$E_{lattice}=-K'\frac{\nu Z^+Z^-}{r_++r_-}$$
		- $\nu$: total number of ions in 1 unit
		- $K'$: "packaged" fundamental constants, with approximations ($M=0.8\nu$, $n=9$)
		$$K'=0.88\frac{N_Ae^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}(1-\frac{1}{9})=1.079\times10^{-4}$$
	- Refined Kapustinskii equation:
	$$E_{lattice}=-K\frac{\nu Z^+ Z^-}{r_++r_-}(1-\frac{d}{r_++r_-})$$
		- Takes covalency into account
		- Inaccuracies result from approximations
- Stability of lattices
	- Born-Haber cycle: ionisation/atomisation energy vs EA and lattice energy
		- Atomisation: analagous to melting point
	- Lattices can be stable with respect to elements, but not other potential lattices
		- Example: $\ce{WF2}$ disproportionates into $\ce{W}$ and $\ce{WF5}$
			- The latter 2 have high lattice energies
## Metallic bonding
- As orbitals of many atoms combine, separation between the resulting orbitals decreases, resulting in a continuous band
- Valence band: filled, conduction band: unfilled, filled level: Fermi level
- Electrical conductivity: easy to decouple electrons from valence to conduction band
- Across a period, orbitals get more compact, there is a higher $\Delta E$ between orbitals, a band gap appears and widens
- Semiconductors: narrow band gap, conductivity increases with temperature
- Down group 14 ($\ce{C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb}$):
	- Structure: diamond
	- $sp^3$ orbitals get more diffuse, leading to smaller band gap
- $\pi-$bonding arrangements: graphite, graphene form $\pi-$bands from p-orbitals
	- Graphite band structure: valence and conduction bands touch, low density of states at band edge
	- Graphene band structure: bands touch, but with 0 density of states at band edge
	- Doping with electorn donor ($\ce{N}$) or acceptor ($\ce{B}$): raises/lowers Fermi level to give higher density of states
- Change in metallic nature and conductivity is mirrored by structural changes
	- Example: group 15 ($\ce{P, As.Sb, Bi}$)
		- Structure: black phosphorus
		- Down the group, reduction in band gap leads to increase in conductivity
		- Layers get closer together, flattening into a hexagonal close packed lattice
