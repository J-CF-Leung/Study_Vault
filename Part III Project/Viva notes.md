# Motivation
- Real time-dependent Hubbard model: orthonormalisation of parameters

# Methods/implementation
- Real part of quasi-energy spectrum
	- Why? Imaginary part small, real part had expected behaviour of a Floquet spectrum

# Low frequency limit
- A solution from diagonalisation?
- Sampling at equal time intervals (doing a Fourier transform?)

# Renormalised parameters
- Into bare parameters: more intuitive

# Avoided crossings
- Near resonance between the singlet states
- Driven tunnelling?

# Discussion section
- Non-Hermiticity:
	- Favouring higher energies up the ladder

- Potential model of static orbitals:
	- $s-p$ orbitals to model _polarisation_ of the 

# Cooper?
- Paper on resonant modulations:

- Topology?
