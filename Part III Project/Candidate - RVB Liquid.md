>The resonant valence bond (RVB) quantum liquid state was proposed by Anderson in the late 80's as a possible competitor to the Neel antiferromagnet. While the idea underpinned a whole new direction of research on quantum spin liquids and topological phases of matter, it was not until very recently that a realisation of an RVB state was proposed in a realistic Hamiltonian for a doped Mott insulator ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03372](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03372)). This raises a new paradigm for the quantum spin liquids based on kinetic energy frustration, rather than geometric frustration of interactions. 
A particular instance where this novel RVB state can be found is the 2D checkerboard lattice, which had been previously studied numerically by Poilblanc ([https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.197204](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.197204)). Notably, Poilblanc considered the additional effect of interactions and showed that this induces pairing between dopants, seemingly mediated by magnetic correlations, of potential interest as a novel route for unconventional superconductivity. 
In this project the student should try and extend Poilblanc's work taking advantage of the new analytical results available in [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03372](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03372). For instance, one could try to compute the statistics of the dopants (believed to be fermions but this is yet to be demonstrated, and it should be possible from the exact wavefunction). One could then try to add interactions at a perturbative level, and see if one can find an analytical understanding of the pairing (beyond Poilblanc's numerics); this will be a very tall order, as the exact ground state is no longer known in presence of interactions; some approximate techniques (possibly aided by numerics) may be needed.

- What is an RVB?
	- Alternative model to Neel antiferromagnet (anti-parallel spins)
	- Spins are _valence bond paired_ into _singlets_
	- The singlets _resonate quantum mechanically_ amongst different _pairing configurations_, which _compensates_ for the _partial loss of antiferromagnetic energy_

- High-temperature superconductivity _may be underpinned by spin-charge separation of strongly correlated electrons in an RVB liquid phase_
	- Strongly correlated: interactions >> free kinetic energy

- Proposal of RVB led to development of _spin liquids_

- Paper - demonstrates that for a _large $U$ Hubbard model_, on a lattice of _corner-sharing tetrahedra_, with _half-filling_, can exhibit _spin-charge separation and RVB behaviour_
	- Lattice: planar checkerboard, or 3D pyrochlore lattice
- Reliant on _kinematic spin correlations_, set by _frustrated hopping_
	- Instance of _counter-Nagaoka effect_
