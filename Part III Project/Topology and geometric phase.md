## Concepts in topology
- Cohomology: invariant integrals
	- For a closed form $f$, some path integral of $f$ is path-independent if the path is moved continuously through a region where $f$ is well-defined

- Homotopy: topological classification
	- A homotopy: smooth mapping between curves on a manifold

- Topological defects: A configuration of a _continuous model_ that cannot smoothly relax into a uniform configuration due to some _nontrivial topological invariant_
	- Example: vortices of non-zero winding number

## Quantum Hall Effect
- The _lowest Landau levels_ in a solid: circular _droplets_ in an area, enclosing one flux quantum per state

- Topological invariant: the Chern number
