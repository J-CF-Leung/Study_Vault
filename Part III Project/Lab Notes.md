- Meeting with Prof. Artacho

- In general, a _time-dependent basis set_ may be _not orthonormal_ (oblique basis set)
- Refer to Phys. Rev. A 43, 5770 (1991) for _nonorthogonal basis sets_
	- Includes second quantisation
- Consequences of time dependence-
	- Differential geometrical interpretation, with _gauge potential_: see Phys. Rev. B 95, 115155 (2017) 
	- Manifold curvature becoming _forces_: see SciPost Physics **12**, 020 (2022)

- Start Lit. review of time-dependent basis here: [[QM in an Evolving Hilbert Space]]

- Implement an _oblique_, _time-dependent_, _second-quantised_ basis set into the Hubbard model
- Simplest: the _Hubbard dimer_

- Need to review [[Floquet theory]]
	- Summary: Bloch's Theorem, but in time
	- Complication- quasi-energy periodicicity

- Result of Hubbard with time-dependent basis: _compare_ with a simple Hubbard model with _time-dependent parameters_
	- The _gauge potential_ should have some physical effect
- Check the _non-adiabatic limit_ (high frequency)
	- Search: Magnussen corrections?

- Potentially allow the _electronic cloud_ in the dimer to _deform_
- By hybridising a $1s$ and $2p$ orbital on _each site_
- Consider if there should be different Hubbard parameters depending on orbitals
