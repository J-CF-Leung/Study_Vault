- Theme: topology + non-equilibrium dynamics (Floquet physics)

## Presentation points
- Past projects-
	- Phonon braiding (topological insulators)
	- Research review?
	- Non-equilibrium dynamics (phonons)
	- Part III: Non-equilibrium + Floquet physics + geometrical interpretations

- Main point: interested in studying topological phenomena (any quasiparticle?), potentially to do with non-equilibrium dynamics/Floquet physics
- Around _3 minutes_ each

### Phonon braiding and topology
- Multi-gap topology and phonon braiding in Kagome monolayer ($\ce{ Zr_{2}O_{3} }$) (with Bo at TCM)
	- Extension of single-gap topologies
- Existence of non-Abelian charges
	- From $PT$ or $C_{2}T$ symmetry
	- Adjacent gaps characterised by _quaternion charges_
	- Computing _relative signs_: Euler curvature, _analagous_ to Berry curvature
	- _Opposite_ charges: annihilate
	- Otherwise: stable w.r.t. noise or environment (topologically protected)

- Conjugation: _braiding_ after crossing Dirac strings
	- Change in _gauge_
- Charges can _annihilate_

- Change band structure due to strain or electric field -> braiding

- Braiding and topological quantum computation
	- Braiding encoded in matrices --> information?

#### Frame charge formation
- An $M-$band subspace within an $N-$band system
- The _spectral decomposition_ of the Hamiltonian gives _real, orthonormal eigenvectors_ which form a _frame_
- There is then a _gauge freedom_, where a _pair_ of eigenvectors can be turned _negative_

- $C_{2}T/PT$ symmetry: the non-Abelian charges are characterised by the _group of all gauge transformations of $N$ ordered orthonormal eigenvectors_, which _preserve handedness_
	- A _discrete group_, generated by $\pi$ rotation of _pairs_ of eigenvectors

- Homotopy group thingy, the _nodes_ can be characterised by _quaternions_
- _Braiding_ represented by _conjugation_ (non-Abelian)

- Nodes of the _same gap_ connected by a Dirac string in _pairs_
	- Indicates a $\pi$ change in _Berry phase_ when _crossing_

- Even for $M$ bands, nodes within one gap, _and its adjacent gaps_ can be independently characterised by _quaternions_
	- _Non-adjacent_ gaps cannot interact
 

### Non-equilibrium dynamics (phonons)
- Phonons: density matrix/open system formalism in electron-phonon systems
	- Liouville-von Neumann equation
	- Usage of Markov approximation
	- A closed form equation for density matrix elements
	- Mean-field approximation

- Extend _beyond_ the semi-classical approximation
	- TCM work: Wigner phase space formulation
- Decoherence time, check with experimental measurements, etc.

- Result: computational implementation on a 1D toy model

### Current project (Floquet physics)
- New formalism: time-dependent basis
- Quantum geometric concepts: connection, manifold curvature, etc.
	- Berry curvature: the _Ricci tensor_
- Comparison to other formalisms (extending the basis set)

- Toy model: Hubbard dimer
- Combine with Floquet physics -> quasi-energy spectrum

## Potential project targeting

### Spin liquids and spin ices
- RVB liquid
	- Topology?
- Relation to topological order and fractionalisation?

### Floquet band engineering
- _Engineer_ some _effective, topologically nontrivial_ Hamiltonian by Floquet driving
- Non-Abelian braiding also achievable
