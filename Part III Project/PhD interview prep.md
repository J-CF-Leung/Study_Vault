- Theme: topology + non-equilibrium dynamics (Floquet physics)

## Presentation points
- Past projects-
	- Phonon braiding (topological insulators)
	- Research review?
	- Non-equilibrium dynamics (phonons)
	- Part III: Non-equilibrium + Floquet physics + geometrical interpretations

- Main point: interested in studying topological phenomena (any quasiparticle?), potentially to do with non-equilibrium dynamics/Floquet physics
- Around _3 minutes_ each

### Phonon braiding and topology
- Multi-gap topology and phonon braiding in Kagome monolayer ($\ce{ Zr_{2}O_{3} }$) (with Bo at TCM)
	- Extension of single-gap topologies
- Existence of non-Abelian charges
	- From $PT$ or $C_{2}T$ symmetry
	- Euler curvature _analagous_ to Berry curvature
- Momentum space braiding due to strain or electric field

- Braiding and topological quantum computation

### Non-equilibrium dynamics (phonons)
- Phonons: density matrix/open system formalism in electron-phonon systems
	- Liouville-von Neumann? 
	- Usage of Markov approximation
	- Lindbladian dynamics?

- Extend _beyond_ the semi-classical approximation
	- Cross-check with TCM work on glasses
- Decoherence time, check with experimental measurements, etc.

### Current project (Floquet physics)
- New formalism: time-dependent basis
- Quantum geometric concepts: manifold curvature, etc.
	- Relation to Berry curvature
