>[!Abstract]
Highly-correlated many-particle problems in condensed matter have been very successfully addressed within the paradigm of the Hubbard model and variants thereof, formulated using second quantisation, referring to a basis set with very few states per site (canonically just one). Very easily formulated, these models describe rich, complex physics, stemming from quite non-trivially entangled many-body states. Recent experimental advances with optical lattices have extended that physics to the realm of periodically-driven time-dependent systems, in what is being called Floquet physics (the Floquet theorem is analogous to Blochâ€™s theorem but referring to periodicity in time instead of space). Novel states of matter are being devised in this context. The same Hubbard-like models described above are being extended to the time-dependent domain, with time-dependent (time-periodic) dependences of their parameters. Some of the new physics relate to time-periodic displacements of the confining potential wells defined by the lasers used to obtain optical lattices. If the underlying basis moves with the confining wells, a gauge potential appears that can be understood in terms of the Hilbert space becoming a curved manifold in a differential geometry context. We will formulate an extension of the simplest Hubbard model for a periodically moving basis, and will explore its effects in a Hubbard dimer as simplest non-trivial system. The solutions will be compared with the presently used conventional model with time-dependent parameters, and with an alernative extension of the model which alllows for the displacement of electrons without moving the basis states. In addition to an initial study of the relevant literature, the work will be mostly analytic, with the help of numerical solution of the final equations, accessible to simple python coding in e.g. Jupyter notebooks.

Hubbard model + Floquet (driven) physics

Highly correlated Floquet system: effective Hamiltonian (Hubbard-like, time dependent)

Non-equiibrium: time dependent basis -> effective gauge potential
Analagous to Berry connection (time dependence instead)
Hubbard model: appears as imaginary hopping

Imaginary hopping: what physics does it describe
New toy model - hopping: from conventional s-s to s-p

Compare with other models
