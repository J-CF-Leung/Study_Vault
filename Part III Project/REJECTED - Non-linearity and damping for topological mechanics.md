- Topology in elasticity and mechanical properties, and phonons

- Material a lot more rigid in the bulk, with some soft edges
	- Analagous to topological insulators
	- Can be at only one boundary (asymmetry)
	- Applications: cushioning

- Design meta-materials with these topological properties to replace composites

- Using a continuum model rather than lattice model
- Need other degrees of freedom other than stress and strain to describe topological properties

- Augment strain with more local deformation fields and its gradients
	- Breaking of inversion symmetry
	- Characterise bulk using topological invariants
	- Weyl modes

- Equations of motion from Euler-Lagrange equations
	- Add damping or viscous terms
	- Mainly analytics
	- More general: maybe numerics
