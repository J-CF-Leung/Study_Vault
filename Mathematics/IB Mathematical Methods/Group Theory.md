- An object being _symmetric_ means that there is a _set of transformations_ which will leave the object _invariant_, or _indistringuishable_ from its original state
- These transformations are known as the _symmetry operations_ of the object

- Sets of symmetry operations can form _groups_

# The definition of a group

## Sets, algebras, and groups
- A _set_ is a _collection of objects_
- If the object $a$ is in the set $S$, it is denoted $a\in S$

- An _algebra_ is a _set_ of objects, along with an _operation_ which _combines two elements_ in the set, to produce _another element of the set_

- A _group_ is an _algebra_ which must _satisfy several axioms_
![[Sets algebras groups.png]]
- A generic group is denoted $G$, with _elements_ $g_1,g_2,\dots$
- The group must also contain a _group product_, denoted $g_1g_2$

## The axioms
- The _axioms_ a group must satisfy:
1. _Closure_: The result of taking a _product_ between any two elements of the group must _also be an element_ of the group $$g_1\in G \hspace{1cm} g_2\in G \Longrightarrow g_1g_2\in G$$
2. _Identity_: There must exist a single _identity element_, denoted by $I$, such that, for _every element_ $g\in G$ $$Ig=g \hspace{1cm} gI=g$$
3. _Inverse_: For every element $g\in G$, there must exist an _inverse_ of that element $g^{-1}\in G$ such that $$gg^{-1}=I=g^{-1}g$$
4. _Associativity_: For any 3 elements $g_1,g_2,g_3\in G$, $$(g_1g_2)g_3=g_1(g_2g_3)$$

## Example: The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition
1. _Closure_: $$a,b\in \mathbb{Z} \Longrightarrow a+b\in\mathbb{Z}$$
2. _Identity_: $$a+0=a \hspace{1cm} 0+a=a$$
3. _Inverse_: $$a+(-a)=0 \hspace{1cm} (-a)+a=0$$
4. _Associativity_: $$(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$$
## Corollaries
- A group's _identity element is unique_
	- Assume that there are two _different_ identity elements, $I$ and $I'$, where $I\neq I'$
	- Using the _definition_ of an identity element: $$II'=I \hspace{1cm} II'=I'$$
	- Therefore, $I=I'$ since the products must be the same

- A group element's _inverse is unique_
	- Assume that for $g\in G$, there are _two inverses_ $h$ and $k$ such that $h\neq k$: $$gh=I \hspace{1cm} kg=I$$
	- Multiply the expression on the left by $k$: $$k(gh)=(kg)h=k$$
	- Since $kh=I$, $h=k$

## Commutativity
- The group of integers under addition is _commutative_:
$$\displaylines{a,b\in\mathbb{Z} \\ a+b=b+a}$$
- However, this property is _not common to all groups_

- For _commutative_, or _Abelian groups_, if $g_1,g_2\in G$:
$$g_1g_2=g_2g_1$$
- For _non-Abelian groups_, if $g_1,g_2\in G$:
$$g_1g_2\neq g_2g_1$$

# A point group: The symmetries of a square
- Consider the _group of transformations_, representing the _symmetries of a square_

- One symmetry operation is _clockwise rotation by $\pi/2$ radians_
- The operation leaves the square _indistinguishable_ from its initial state
- To illustrate its effect, one puts _labels_ on the corners, which _do not affect the symmetry_

- Denote this _rotation_ by: $$g_1=R$$ ![[Square rotation.png]]
- Denote a _reflection_ by: $$g_2=m_1$$ ![[Square reflection.png]]
- Define the _group product_ as applying operations _successively_
- The convention for _successive operations_ is from _right-to-left_
- Then, do a _rotation followed by reflection_, denoting it by:$$m_1R$$![[Square m1R.png]]
- Then, do a _reflection followed by rotation_, denoting it by: $$Rm_1$$ ![[Square Rm1.png]]

- _Successive_ rotations, by $0$, $\pi/2$, $\pi$, and $3\pi/2$ radians in total can be denoted:
$$I, R, R^2, R^3$$
- Meanwhile, a rotation by $2\pi$ radians:$$R^4=I$$
- The _mirror planes_ can also be denoted:
![[Square mirror planes.png]]
- Each symmetry is its _own inverse_:
$$m_i^2=I$$
- The symmetries are _algebraically related_:
$$\displaylines{m_1m_2=m_2m_1=m_3m_4=m_4m_3=R^2 \\ m_1m_3=m_4m_1=m_2m_4=m_3m_2=R^3=R^{-1}}$$
- There is some _minimal subset_ of operations, from which _all other_ operations of the group can be _obtained by composition_
- In other words, the group is _generated_ from this subset, elements of which are known as the _generators_

- In this case, the _generators_ are $\{R, m_1\}$:
	- All _successive rotations_ are obtained by repeatedly applying $R$
	- The mirror planes are then generated by: $$m_2=R^3m_1 \hspace{1cm} m_3=R^2m_1 \hspace{1cm} m_4=Rm_1$$
	- The _identity element_ can be generated in two different ways: $$m_1^2=I \hspace{1cm} R^4=I$$
- In summary, the _subset $\{R,m_1\}$ generates the entire group_:
$$\{I,R,R^2,R^3,m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4\}=\{R^4,R,R^2,R^3,m_1,R^3m_1,R^2m_1,Rm_1\}$$
- This is known as the _$4-$fold dihedral group_ $D_4$
- In general, the symmetry group for a _regular polygon of $n$ sides_ is the $n-$_fold dihedral group_ $D_n$

- These are _point groups_, where a single point is _fixed_ under all symmetry operations

# Orders
- The _order_ $|G|$ of a group $G$ is _how many elements it contains_

- If a group has _infinitely many elements_, it is called an _infinite group_
- Example: the _dihedral groups_ $$|D_n|=2n$$
- The _order of a group element_ $g\in G$ is the _least integer_ $q$ such that:
$$g^q=I$$
- Since a group is _closed_, $\{I,g,g^2,\dots g^{q-1}\}\in G$
- Hence:
$$q\leq|G|$$
- If an element $g$ has order $q$:
$$g^{-1}=g^{q-1}$$
# Subgroups
- Consider the _multiplication table_ for a group
- The elements of the table are $g_2g_1$, where $g_1$ is on the _top row_, and $g_2$ is on the _left row_:
![[D4 multiplication table.png]]
- Each row is a _complete rearrangement_ of every other row
- Each element only _appears in a row once_

- A _subgroup_ of $G$ is a _subset_ of $G$ which is _a group in its own right_
- If $H$ is a _subset_ of $G$, $H\subset G$
- If $H$ is a _subgroup_ of $G$, $H<G$

- By inspection, $D_4$ has 5 order-2 subgroups:
$$\{I,R^2\}, \{I, m_1\}, \{I, m_2\}, \{I, m_3\}, \{I, m_4\}$$
- There is also an order-4 subgroup:
$$\{I,R,R^2,R^3\}$$
- This is a _cyclic group_, which is a group _generated by a single element_
- A cyclic group of order $n$ can be written as:
$$\{I,g,g^2,\dots,g^{n-1}\}$$
- This group is denoted $C_n$

- There are other order-4 subgroups:
$$\{I,R^2,m_1m_2\}, \{I,R^2,m_3,m_4\}$$
- They are examples of _Klein 4-groups_, or $K_4$
	- Or _Vierergruppe_, denoted $V$

- Although $D_4$ itself is _non-Abelian_, its _subgroups_ are

# Mappings
- A _mapping_ is basically a _single-valued function_
- A mapping:
$$f:G\to G'$$
- This _associates_ an element $f(g)\in G'$ to an element $g\in G$

- A mapping is _one-to-one_ if $f(g_1)=f(g_2)$ _implies_ $g_1=g_2$
- A mapping is _onto_ if for every $g'\in G'$, there is _at least one_ $g\in G$ such that $f(g)=g'$
	![[1-1 vs onto.png]]
	- Left: One-to-one, but _not onto_
	- Right: Onto, but _not one-to-one_

- Let there be a mapping is _between two finite groups of the same order_ $G$ and $G'$, i.e. $$f:G\to G' \;\;\;\text{ with }\;\;\; |G|=|G'|$$
- If the mapping is one-to-one, then it is _also onto_
- If such a mapping _preserves the group operations_ (i.e. the _structure of the group table_ stays the same), then the groups are said to be _isomorphic_, and the mapping is known as an _isomorphism_
- Let the group operation in $G$ be denoted $\circ$, and the group operation in $G'$ be $*$
- For $G$ and $G'$ to be _isomorphic_:
$$\text{If }g_3=g_1\circ g_2\text{ , then } f(g_3)=f(g_1)*f(g_2)$$
- For isomorphic groups, the _identities map onto each other_:
$$\displaylines{ I'=f(I) \\ h\circ g=I \Longrightarrow f(h)*f(g)=I'}$$
