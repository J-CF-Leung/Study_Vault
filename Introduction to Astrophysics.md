- Distances
	- Nearby objects: stellar parallax (astrometry)
	- Far objects: brightness (photometry)
	- Distant objects: redshift and Hubble's law

- Masses: Newton/Kepler's Laws + _velocity_ measurements
	- Or gravitational lensing
- Velocities: Spectrograph/Doppler shift

- Radius of _Earth's orbit_: 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) = $1.496\times 10^{11}\,\text{m}$
- Sun and moon: 0.5 arcminutes in the sky
- Parsec: distance from the Sun of an object such that the _radius of Earth's orbit_ subtends 1 arcsecond at the object = 206265 AU
- Mass of sun: $1.989\times 10^{30}\,\text{kg}$
- Radius of the Sun: $6.96\times 10^{8}Â \,\text{m}$
